<h2>Note by the Author</h2>

<p>The little story "A Virginia Cousin," here
put into print for the first time, is in some
sort a tribute offered by a long-exiled child of the
South to her native soil. It is also a transcript
of certain phases of that life in the metropolis
which has been pooh-poohed by some critics as
trivially undeserving of a chronicler, but fortunate
hitherto in finding a few readers willing to concede
as much humanity to the "heroine in satin"
as to the "confidante in linen."</p>

<p>Of the other contents of this volume, "Out of
Season" made its first appearance some time ago
in <i>Two Tales</i>, and "On Frenchman's Bay" was
published in <i>The Cosmopolitan Magazine</i>.</p>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>Mr. Theodore Vance Townsend
awoke to the light of a spring morning
in New York, feeling at odds with
the world. The cause for this state of
variance with existing circumstances was
not at sight apparent. He was young,
good-looking, well-born, well-mannered,
and, to support these claims to favorable
consideration, had come into the fortunes
of a father and two maiden aunts,&mdash;a
piece of luck that had, however, not
secured for him the unqualified approbation
of his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>Joined to the fact that, upon first leaving
college, some years before, he had led
a few <i>cotillons</i> at New York balls, his
wealth and leisure had brought upon
Townsend the reproach of the metropolitan
press to the extent that nothing short
of his committing suicide would have induced
it to look upon anything he did as
in earnest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>With an inherited love of letters, he had
dabbled in literature so far as to write and
publish a book of verse, of fair merit,
which, however, had been received with
tumultuous rhapsodies of satire by the professional
critics. The style and title of
"Laureate of the 400," applied in this
connection, had indeed clung to him and
made life hateful in his sight. To escape
it and the other rubs of unoccupied solvency,
he had made many journeys into
foreign countries, had gone around the
globe, and, in due course, had always come
to the surface in New York again, with a
sort of doglike attachment to the place of
his birth that would not wear away.</p>

<p>Of the society he was familiar with,
Vance was profoundly weary. Of domestic
ties, he had only a sister, married to a
rich banker, and in possession of a fine
new house, whose tapestries and electric
lighting occupied all her thoughts and conversation
that could be spared for things
indoors. Away from home, Mrs. Clifton
was continually on the wing, attending
to the demands of philanthropy or
charity, and to cultivation of the brain in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
classes of women of incomes equal to her
own. Whenever her brother dined with
her, she entertained him with a voluble
flow of conversation about these women
and their affairs, never failing, however, to
exhibit her true sisterly feeling by telling
Vance that she could not see why in the
world he did not marry Kitty Ainger and
settle down.</p>

<p>By dint of much iteration, this suggestion
of Kitty Ainger as a wife had come
to take languid possession of the young
man's brain. Besides, he liked Miss Ainger
as well as admired her, and was perhaps
more content in her company than
in that of anybody else he knew.</p>

<p>On the spring morning in question, he
had awaked in a flood of sunshine and
fresh air that poured through the open
windows of his room. His cold bath, his
simple breakfast, his ride in the Park,
brought his sensations of physical well-being
to a point that almost excited his
spirits to strike a balance of youthful cheerfulness.
He forgot his oppressive belongings,
the obloquy they had conferred upon
him in the minds of men who make public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
opinion about others as citizens, his
unreasonable stagnation of ambition.</p>

<p>As he cantered along the equestrian
byways of the Park, and felt, without
noting, the stir of new life in nature, he
grew light of heart and buoyant. And as
this condition increased, his thoughts crystallized
around the image of Katherine
Ainger. She, too, loved her morning ride;
no doubt he should meet her presently.
He had not seen her since Thursday of
last week, when he had taken her in to
dinner at Mrs. Cartwright's; and he had
a vague idea she had resented him a little
on that occasion. Her talk had been a
trifle baffling, her eyes evasive. But she
had worn a stunning gown, and was by all
odds the best-looking woman of the lot.
How well she sat at table, by the way!
What an admirable figure for a man who
would be forced to entertain, to place at
the head of his board in perpetuity!</p>

<p>Their families, too, had always known
each other. And she was so uncommonly
level-headed and sensible! Agreeable, too;
no whims, no fancies. He had never
heard of her being ill for a day. As to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
temper and disposition, they matched all
the rest. She had never flirted; and, marrying
at twenty-six a husband of twenty-nine,
she would give him no possible
anxiety on that score.</p>

<p>Yes, his sister was right; everybody
was right. Miss Ainger was the mate
designed for him by heaven; and he had
been a fool to dawdle so long in making
up his mind to accept the fact.</p>

<p>As the sunshine warmed him, and his
horse forged along with a beautiful even
stride beneath him, Vance worked up to
a degree of enthusiasm he had not felt
since he played on a winning football
eleven in a college game. That very day
he would seek her and ask her to be his
wife. They would be married as soon as
she was willing, and would go away in
the yacht somewhere and learn to love
each other. He would have an aim, a
home, a stake in the community. At
thirty years of age, he should be found no
longer in dalliance with time to make it
pass away.</p>

<p>Vance, enamored of these visions, finished
the circuit of the Park without seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
the central object of them, with whom
he had resolved to make an appointment
to receive him at home that afternoon.
He rode back to the stable where he kept
his horse, left it there, and, getting into an
elevated car, went down-town to visit his
lawyer, going with that gentleman afterwards
into the stately halls of the Lawyers'
Club for luncheon.</p>

<p>At a table near him, Vance saw, sitting
alone, a man named Crawford, whom he
had met casually and knew for a hardworking
and ambitious junior member of
the New York bar. They exchanged
nods, and Vance fancied that Crawford
looked at him with a scrutiny more close
than the occasion warranted.</p>

<p>"You know Crawford, then?" said
Mr. Gleason, an old friend of Vance's
father. "He began work with our firm,
but had an offer for a partnership in a year
or two, and left us. He's a tremendous
fellow to grind, but is beginning to reap
the benefit of it in making a name for himself.
If that fellow had a little capital,
there is nothing he could not do, in this
community. He has never been abroad,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
has had no pleasures of society, leads a
scrupulously regular life, drinks no liquors
or wines of any kind, and is in bed by
twelve o'clock every night of his life.
His only indulgence is to buy books, with
which his lodgings overflow. We have
always supposed him to be a woman-hater,
until latterly, when straws seem to
show that the wind blows for him from a
point of sentiment. He was in the Adirondacks
last summer, in camp with a
friend, and I've an idea he met his fate
then. After all, Vance, my dear boy,
marriage is the goal man runs for, be he
what he may. It will develop John Crawford,
just as it would develop you, in the
right direction; and I heartily wish you
would tell me when you intend to succumb
to the universal fate, and fall in
love."</p>

<p>"I heartily wish I could," said Vance,
with a tinge of the mockery he had that
morning put aside.</p>

<p>At that moment, Crawford, who had
finished his luncheon, passed their table,
hat in hand, bowing and smiling as he did
so. A waiter, jostling by, made him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
loosen his hold of the hat, a rather shabby
light-brown Derby, that rolled under
Vance Townsend's feet. It was lifted
by Vance and restored to its owner before
the waiter could reach the spot; and again
Vance thought he detected a look of significance,
incomprehensible to him, in the
frank eyes Crawford turned upon him as
he expressed his thanks.</p>

<p>"It would have been a benefit to Crawford's
friends to have accidentally put your
foot through that hat," said Mr. Gleason,
laughing. "He is accused by them of
having worn it ever since he was admitted
to the bar. But then, who thinks of
clothes, with a real man inside of them?
And no doubt the girl they say he is going
to marry will right these trifling matters
in short order."</p>

<p>"I like Crawford; I must see more of
him," replied Vance. "He strikes me as
the fellow to pass a pleasant evening with.
I wonder if he would come to dine with
me."</p>

<p>"If you bait your invitation with an
offer to show your first editions, no doubt
of it," said Mr. Gleason. "But to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
back to our conversation, Vance. When are
we to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I decline to answer," interrupted the
young man, smiling, nevertheless, in such
a way that Mr. Gleason built up a whole
structure of probabilities upon that single
smile.</p>

<p>Yes, Vance decided, everything conspired
to urge him toward his intended
venture that afternoon. When, about four
o'clock, he turned his steps in the direction
of Miss Ainger's home, he had reached
a pitch of very respectably loverlike anxiety.
He even fancied the day had been
unusually long. He caught himself speculating
as to where she would be sitting in
the drawing-room, how she would look
when he laid his future in her hands.</p>

<p>At that moment, he allowed himself to
remember a series of occasions during the
years of their friendship, upon any one of
which he believed he might have spoken
as he now meant to speak, and that she
would have answered as he now expected
her to answer. Ah! what had he not
lost? In her gentle, equable companionship,
he would have been a better, a higher,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
a less discontented fellow. All the virtues,
charms, desirable qualities, of this fine
and high-bred young woman, who had been
more patient, more forgiving, than he deserved,
were concentrated into one small
space of thought, like the Lord's Prayer
engraved upon a tiny coin. But even as
his foot touched the lowest step of her
father's portal, he experienced a shock of
doubt of himself and of his own stability.
He tarried; he turned away, and strolled,
whither he knew not.</p>

<p>In the adjoining street lived Mrs. Myrtle,
an aunt of his, to whom, it must be
said, Vance rarely paid the deference considered
by that excellent lady her just due.
She inhabited the brown-stone dwelling in
which, as a bride, she had gone to housekeeping
when New York society was still
within limits of visitors on foot. Not that
that made any difference to Mrs. Myrtle,
who had always kept her carriage, and had,
about twenty years back, been cited as a
leader of the metropolitan <i>beau monde</i>.</p>

<p>In those days, whether on wheels or
a-foot, everybody went to Mrs. Myrtle's
Thursdays. Her spacious drawing-rooms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
papered in crimson flock paper, with their
massive doors and mouldings and mirror-frames
and curtain-tops of ebonized wood
with gold scroll decorations, their furniture
in the same wood, with red satin
damask coverings, had, in their time, contained
the elect of good society. The
pictures upon Mrs. Myrtle's walls, and the
statuary scattered on pedestals about the
rooms, were then quoted by the newspapers,
and by those so favored as to see them, as
a rare display of the highest art, accumulated
by an American householder. One
of the earliest affronts of many unintentionally
put upon his aunt by Vance had
been his contemptuous shrug of the shoulders
when called upon by her, shortly after
his return from his first winter spent in
Italy, to view her "statuary."</p>

<p>Since then, Mrs. Myrtle had, little by
little, come to a perception of the fact that
her "art collection" was not, any more
than its mistress, an object of the first
importance to New York. But Vance
had been always associated in her mind
with the incipient stages of enlightenment,
and she loved him accordingly. Her love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
for Vance's sister, Mrs. Clifton, who refused
to pay her tribute, and belonged to
the new "smart set," was even less.</p>

<p>Upon Mrs. Myrtle, Vance now resolved
to pay a long-deferred duty-call. Admitted
by an old negro butler, he was left alone
in the large darkling drawing-room, in the
shade of the crimson curtains, amid the
ghostly ranks of the statues, to ruminate
until Mrs. Myrtle should make her appearance.
Little thought did he bestow upon
the duration of this ordeal. He was well
occupied, and, for once in his life, heartily
ashamed,&mdash;&mdash;first, of his indecision upon the
Ainger door-steps, and, secondly, of the
fact that he had put in here to gain courage
to return there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Myrtle's heavy tread upon her
own parquet floor aroused him from meditation.
His aunt was a massive lady, who
wore black velvet, with a neck-ruff of old
point-lace; who, never pretty, and no
longer pleasant to look upon, yet carried
herself with a certain ease born of assurance
in her own place in life, and cultivated
by many years of receiving visitors.
Her small white hand, twinkling with diamonds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
was extended to him with something
of the grand air he remembered his
mother, who was the beauty of her family,
to have possessed; and then Mrs. Myrtle,
seating herself, fixed an unsmiling gaze
upon her nephew.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ah&mdash;thought I would look in and
see how you are getting on," he said, with
an attempt at jocularity.</p>

<p>"But it is not Thursday," she answered,
cold as before. "I make it a
point to see no one except on Thursday,
or after five. And it is not yet after
five."</p>

<p>Townsend, who could not dispute this
fact, was at a loss how to go on. But
Mrs. Myrtle, having put things upon the
right footing, launched at once into an exposition
of her grievances against him, his
sister, and the ruling society of latter-day
New York.</p>

<p>"I am sure if any one had told your
mother and me, when we first came out,
what people were to push <i>us</i> against the
wall, and to have all New York racing
and tearing after their invitations, we
should never have believed it. It's enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
to make your poor mother come back from
the dead, to revise Anita Clifton's visiting-list.
And I suppose the next thing to
hear of will be your marriage into one of
these bran-new families. I must say,
Theodore, although it is seldom my opinion
is listened to, I <i>was</i> pleased when I
heard, the other day, that you were reported
engaged to Katherine Ainger. The
Aingers are of our own sort; and her
fortune, although it is not so important to
you, will be handsome. She is one of the
few girls who go much into the world who
still remember to come to see me; and
she has been lunching here to-day."</p>

<p>"Really?" said Vance, turning over his
hat in what he felt to be a most perfunctory
way.</p>

<p>"Yes; if you or Anita Clifton had been
here in the last two months, you might
have found out that I have had a young
lady&mdash;a Southern cousin&mdash;stopping in the
house."</p>

<p>"A cousin of mine?" queried the
young man, indifferently.</p>

<p>"My first cousin's daughter, Evelyn
Carlyle. You know there was a break
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
between the families about the beginning
of the war, and, for one reason or another,
we have hardly met since. When I went
to the Hot Springs for my rheumatism last
year,&mdash;you and Anita Clifton doubtless
are not aware that I have been a great
sufferer from rheumatism,&mdash;I stopped a
night or two at Colonel Carlyle's house
in Virginia, and took rather a fancy to this
girl. I found out that she has a voice, and
desired to cultivate it in New York, and
so invited her to come on after Christmas
and stay in my house."</p>

<p>Vance was conscious of a slight feeling
of somnolence. Really, he could not be
expected to care for the Virginian cousin's
voice. And Aunt Myrtle had such a
soporific way of drawling out her sentences!
He wished she would return to
the subject of her luncheon-guest, and
then, perhaps, he might manage to keep
awake.</p>

<p>"So you invited Miss Ainger to-day, to
keep the young lady company?" he ventured
to observe.</p>

<p>"If you will give me time to explain,
I will tell you that Katherine Ainger and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
she have struck up the greatest friendship
this winter, and have been together part
of every day. I wish, Vance, that you
could bring yourself to extend some attention
to your mother's first cousin's child.
From Anita Clifton I expect nothing&mdash;absolutely
nothing. Not belonging to the
'smart set,' whatever that may be, I make
no demands upon Anita Clifton. But you,
Vance, have not yet shown that you are
absolutely heartless. When Eve goes
home, as she soon will, it would be gratifying
to have her able to say you had recognized
her existence."</p>

<p>"I will leave a card for the young lady
in the hall," he said, awkwardly; "and
perhaps she would allow me to order some
flowers for her. Just now, Aunt Myrtle,
I have an engagement, and I must really
be going on."</p>

<p>He had risen to his feet, and Mrs. Myrtle
was about shaping a last arrow to aim
at him, when the door opened, and a girl
came into the room.</p>

<p>"Oh! Cousin Augusta," she said, in
the most outspoken manner, a slight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Southern accent marking some of the
syllables enunciated in a remarkably sweet
voice, "I have been taking your Dandie
Dinmont for a walk, and he has been such
a good, obedient dear, you must give him
two lumps of sugar when he comes to tea
at five o'clock."</p>

<p>As Mrs. Myrtle performed the ceremony
of introduction between them, Vance
became conscious that he was in the presence
of one of the most radiantly pretty
young persons who had ever crossed the
line of his languid vision. Equipped in a
tailor-made frock of gray serge, a black
hat with many rampant plumes upon her
red-brown hair, a boa of black ostrich
feathers curling around her pearly throat
and caressing the rosiest of cheeks, his
Cousin Eve surveyed him with as much
indifference as if he had been the veriest
casual met in a crowd in Fifth Avenue.
Two fingers of a tiny gloved hand were
bestowed on him in recognition of their
relationship, after which she resumed her
interrupted talk about the dog.</p>

<p>"You understand that Mr. Townsend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
is a relative, my dear?" asked Mrs. Myrtle,
in her rocking-horse manner. "You
have heard me speak of him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; oh, yes, certainly," Eve said,
with preoccupation. "But to us Virginians
a cousin means either very much&mdash;or
very, very little."</p>

<p>"The presumption, then, is against
me?" he asked, determined not to be
subdued.</p>

<p>"Is it? I had not thought," she answered,
hardly looking in his direction.
Vance took the hint and his departure.
When again out of doors, he straightened
himself, and walked with a firmer, more
determined tread, conscious of a little
tingling in his veins on the whole not disagreeable.
In this mood, he reached the
corner of the street in which dwelt Miss
Ainger, and was very near indeed to passing
it, but, recovering himself with a start,
turned westward from the Avenue, and
again sought the house from which he had
gone irresolute a little while before.</p>

<p>The door was opened for him by a servant,
who did not know "for sure," but
"rather thought" Miss Ainger was in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
drawing-room. While following the man
across a wide hall, Vance espied, lying upon
a chair, a man's hat&mdash;not the conventional
high black hat of the afternoon
caller, but a rusty brown "pot" hat, of
an unobtrusive pattern.</p>

<p>"Humph! the piano-tuner, no doubt,"
he said to himself, and simultaneously recalled
the fact that he had seen the object
in question, or its twin brother, that same
day. Before the footman could put his
hand upon the knob of the drawing-room
door, it opened, and the owner of the hat
came out. It was indeed Crawford,
dressed in morning tweeds, as Vance had
seen him at luncheon in the Lawyers'
Club, his plain, strong face illuminated
with an expression Vance knew nothing
akin to, and therefore did not interpret.</p>

<p>But Vance did know Miss Ainger for
an independent in her set, a girl who struck
out for herself to find clever and companionable
people with whom to fraternize;
and he was accordingly not surprised to
meet Crawford here as a visitor. As once
before that day, the two men exchanged
silent nods, and parted. Vance found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Miss Ainger caressing with dainty fingertips
a large bunch of fresh violets that lay
in her lap and filled the room with fragrance.</p>

<p>Kitty Ainger, a daughter of New York,
calm, reserved, temperamentally serious,
fond of argument upon high themes, cultivated
in minor points to a fastidious degree,
handsome in a sculptural way, had
always seemed to him lacking in the one
grace of womanly tenderness he vaguely
felt to be of vast moment in a young man's
choice for a wife.</p>

<p>To-day, as she greeted him, her manner
was gentle and gracious to perfection.
Perhaps it so appeared in contrast to that
of the fair Phyllida who had flouted him
in his Aunt Myrtle's drawing-room; perhaps
Kitty was really glad of this first
occasion in many days when they were
alone together, undisturbed.</p>

<p>The thought caused a wave of excitement
to rise in the suitor's veins. He
wondered how he could have held back,
an hour before, when upon the threshold
of such an opportunity. But then, had he
made appearance, no doubt there would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
have been other visitors,&mdash;Crawford, for
instance, whom Miss Ainger was plainly
taking by the hand, to lead into society, as
clever girls will do when they find an unknown
clever man; Crawford, who did
not know enough of conventionality to
put on a black coat when he called on a
girl in the afternoon; Crawford, poor and
plain, a man's man, whom the Ainger family
no doubt regarded as one of Kitty's
freaks. Yes, Crawford would have been
a decided interruption to this <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>Now, there was an open sea before
Vance, and he had only to launch the
boat, so long delayed, a craft he at last
candidly believed to be freighted with the
best hopes of his life. They talked for
awhile upon impersonal subjects&mdash;Kitty
exerting herself, he could see, to be agreeable
and sympathetic with her visitor. In
the progress of this conversation, he took
note with satisfaction of the artistic elegance
of her dress (of the exact color of
the Peach Blow Vase, he said to himself,
searching for a simile in tint), with sleeves
of sheenful velvet, and a silken train that
lay upon the rug. Her long, white fingers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
playing with the violets, wore no
rings. Her slim figure, her braids of pale
brown hair, her calm, gray eyes, attracted
him as never before, with their girlish and
yet womanly composure.</p>

<p>"Why have you never told me," he
said abruptly, "of your friendship with
that little witch of a Virginia cousin of
mine who has been staying with Mrs.
Myrtle this winter?"</p>

<p>"If you wish me to tell you the truth,
it was because she asked me never to do
so," replied Kitty, coloring a little. "You
have met her?" she added eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, to-day; a little while ago, when
I called upon my aunt. But how could
she know of me? What reason was
there for her to avoid me?"</p>

<p>"Evelyn is an impulsive creature," was
the answer; and now the blood rushed into
Kitty's cheek, and she was silent.</p>

<p>"Impulsive, yes; but how could she
resent a man she had never seen; who
had not had the smallest opportunity to
prove whether or not he was obnoxious to
her? That is quite too ridiculous, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
think. You, who have so much sense,
character, judgment, why could not you
exercise your influence over this very provincial
little person, and teach her that a
prejudice is, of all things, petty?"</p>

<p>"She is not a provincial little person,"
said Kitty, with spirit. "And she does
not merit that patronizing tone of yours."</p>

<p>"If <i>you</i> take her under your wing, she
is perfection," he answered lightly, as if
the subject were no longer of value for
discussion. "But before we begin to
differ about her, only tell me if it is my
Aunt Myrtle's objection to me as a type
that my truculent Cousin Eve has inherited?"</p>

<p>"I hardly think so. Please ask me no
questions," the girl said, uncomfortable
with blushing.</p>

<p>"As you like. It is veiled in mystery,"
he said, rather piqued. "At least, you
won't mind informing me if she got any
of her ideas of me from you. No, that
is hardly fair. I will alter it. Did you
and she ever speak of me together?"</p>

<p>"What if I tell you yes, and that, every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
time we met?" exclaimed Miss Ainger,
plucking up courage when thus driven into
a corner.</p>

<p>To her surprise and dismay, Vance took
this admission quite otherwise than she
had meant it. In Eve's attitude toward
him, he thought he read a girlish jealousy
of the object preoccupying the affections
of her friend.</p>

<p>"I see. I understand," he said, with a
gleam in his eyes she had not seen there
in all of their acquaintance. Until now,
the hearth-rug had been between them.
With an animation quite foreign to him,
he crossed it, and leaned down to take her
hands. At once, Kitty, withdrawing from
his grasp, rose to her feet and faced him.</p>

<p>"I think there is some great mistake,"
she said, very quietly. As Vance gazed
at her, he became aware that he had until
now never seen the true Kitty Ainger, and
that her face was beautiful.</p>

<p>"You repulse me? You have never
cared for me?" he said, fiercely.</p>

<p>A wave of color came upon her cheeks,
and her eyes dropped before his to the violets
in her hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>"I must tell you," she said, after a pause,
during which both thought of many
things stretching back through many years,
"that I have just promised to marry Mr.
Crawford."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>The day of Miss Ainger's marriage
with Crawford, which took place in
New York, a month later than the events
heretofore recorded, found Vance Townsend
on horseback in Virginia, following,
with no especial purpose, a highway that
crosses the Blue Ridge Mountains to
descend sharply into the valley of the
Shenandoah.</p>

<p>Before leaving home, he had acquitted
himself of conventional duty to the bride
by ordering to be sent to her the finest
antique vase of his collection,&mdash;a gem
of carved metal that Cellini might have
signed,&mdash;filled with boughs of white lilac,
his card and best wishes accompanying it.
Then, with a heart overburdened, as he
fancied, with regretful self-reproach, he
had turned his back upon the chief might-have-been
of his experience.</p>

<p>Katherine, who had, in fact, passed
many days in her paternal mansion unsought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
by him, was now invested with a
veil of tender sentiment. In his waistcoat
pocket he carried an unfinished poem,
addressed to her,&mdash;or to an idealized version
of Miss Ainger,&mdash;which, at intervals
on his journey, he would take out and polish
and shape with assiduity, forgetting
sometimes to sigh over it in his zeal for
metrical construction.</p>

<p>The morning of the day that was to see
the prize he had lost become definitely
another's beheld Vance bargaining with a
farmer&mdash;a former cavalryman in the
Confederate service&mdash;to ride one of the
two horses he had shipped by train from
New York, and serve as guide in the war-harried
region through which he desired
to pass.</p>

<p>The process was a simple one, the sum
negligently offered for his services for a
day sufficing to cover the expenses of ex-corporal
Claggett for a fortnight, and leave
a margin to fill his pipe with. Therefore,
the rusty squire in attendance (to whom
the treat of bestriding a steed like this
would have been requital all-sufficient),
the riders left the village that had sheltered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Townsend for the night, and at once
set out to ascend a long and toilsome hill,
giving views on every side of an enchanting
prospect.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to appear boastful, suh,"
observed Mr. Claggett, modestly, "an' I
ain't travelled much myself out o' this
State, but I've heerd people say this 'ere
view beats creation."</p>

<p>"It is very fine, certainly, Claggett,"
replied Vance, halting to look back at the
wide expanse of hill and valley mantled
with springing green, the far-off, grassy
heights serving as pasture for sheep and
cows, and scattered with limestone boulders,
against which redbud and dogwood
in blossom made brilliant patches; with
mountains beyond, above, everywhere, and
all of that exquisite, velvet-textured shade
of blue, so soft and melting it seems to
invite caress.</p>

<p>"By Jove! It is well named the Blue
Ridge," Vance went on, approvingly.</p>

<p>"Jest there, Mr. Townsend, in that
very spot where the old red cow's a-munchin'
in the grass, was where Pelham
stood when his artillery let fly at them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
plucky Yankee cavalry that was behind
the stone wall firin' like fury at our
Confeds."</p>

<p>"And who was Pelham?" asked the
visitor, with interest.</p>

<p>"Never heard o' Pelham? Well, I
wouldn't 'a' thought it," was the compassionate
answer. "Why, suh, he was a
boy,&mdash;major of artillery&mdash;nuthin' but a
boy,&mdash;an' they killed him early in the
war. But he'd the skill an' the sense of
an old general; an' there wornt no risk to
himself he'd stop at in a fight. He'd just
<i>swipe</i> vict'ry, every time, suh, Pelham
would; an' he was the pride an' idol of
our army. Thar! them johnny-jump-ups
are growin' where his gun stood, an' he
rammin' charges into it with his own hand,
when he sent that murderin' volley that
made batterin'-rams out o' the stones o'
the wall here, an' druv the poor Yankees
behind it into Kingdom Come. Things
look different to me, suh, now. I was a
youngster, then, run mad to git into any
kind o' fightin'; but I've got sons o' my
own now, an' I can't somehow see the
pints in all that killin' we did in our war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
like I used to. But I can't think o' fellers
like Pelham without wantin' to be in
it again, suh.</p>

<p>"Why, at Snicker's Gap (heard o'
Snicker's Gap, Mr. Townsend?) that lad,
who was commandin' Stuart's horse-artillery,
charged on a squadron of cavalry
that had been botherin' him with its sharp-shooters,
and, with a gun that they'd
dragged by hand through the undergrowth,
fired a double charge of canister into their
reserves. Then, suh, he charged agin,&mdash;a
reg'lar thunderbolt that sally was,&mdash;picked
up sev'ral prisoners an' horses,
an', limberin' up his gun like wild-fire,
hurried back to his first position, his men
shoutin' for him all the while."</p>

<p>"Those were stirring days for you,
Claggett," said Townsend, whose blood
began to answer to the man's enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Townsend, they were so;
but you mustn't let me impose on you
with my war stories. My present wife,
suh,&mdash;a young lady I courted in King
William, about the age of my oldest daughter,&mdash;she
won't have me open my mouth
'bout war stories at our house. Says I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
tire everybody out with my old chestnuts,
suh; an' perhaps I do. The ladies like
to do a good deal of the talkin' themselves,
I've noticed, Mr. Townsend."</p>

<p>With a subdued sigh, Claggett subsided
into silence, but not for long. The names
of Stuart and Mosby and their officers
were ever upon his lips, interspersed with
anecdote and gossip concerning the country
people whose dwellings were only occasionally
seen from the road. Here and
there, in the distance, chimneys behind
clumps of trees were pointed out as belonging
to old inhabitants who had held
on to their homes through storm and stress
of ill-fortune since the war.</p>

<p>"Since you are from the Nawth, I
would like to tell you, suh, that nobody
who is anybody among our gentry ever
lived in a village. They lived to themselves,
suh, an' the further away from
each other the better. If you had the
time, suh, an' were acquainted with the
families, I could show you some places
that would surprise you. An' the ladies
an' gentlemen, Mr. Townsend, of our
best old stock are as fine people as any on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
God's earth, I reckon. Pity you ain't
acquainted, as I said. It would give me
pleasure to take you inside some of the
gates of our foremost residents."</p>

<p>Vance noted with amusement that
Claggett did not assume to be on a social
plane with the people he extolled, but had
accepted the tradition of their superiority
as part of the Virginian creed. Laughing,
he joined in the honest fellow's regret at
his ineligibility to take rank as a guest in
the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Though it seems to me, Claggett, now
that I think of it, I have a kinsman somewhere
hereabout. Do you know anything
of a family of Carlyles&mdash;Colonel Carlyle,
I believe they call him?"</p>

<p>Claggett's manner underwent instant
transformation.</p>

<p>"Colonel Guy Carlyle, of the Hall,
suh?" he exclaimed, eagerly. "That's
in the next county, a matter of twenty or
thirty miles from here. I had the luck to
serve under the Colonel, Mr. Townsend,
and he'd know me if you spoke my name.
You'll be goin' that way, suh? We'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
strike north from Glenwood, and get there by
supper-time."</p>

<p>"Hold on, Claggett, you'll be pouring
out my coffee and asking me to take
more of the Colonel's waffles, presently.
Colonel Carlyle married my mother's
cousin, but I fancy would not recognize
my name as quickly as yours. I have certainly
no grounds for venturing to offer
myself as an inmate of his house."</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, suh, but the
Colonel'd never get over a relation ridin'
so near the Hall an' not stoppin' there
to sleep," persisted Claggett. "It's a
thing nobody ever heard of, down this
way."</p>

<p>"I shall have to brave tradition, then,"
answered Vance, indifferently.</p>

<p>"It's a fine old place, suh. House
built by the Hessian prisoners in the Revolution,
and splendid furniture. They do
say there's one mirror in the big saloon
that covers fourteen foot of wall, Mr.
Townsend. Yanks bivouacked in that
room, too, but didn't so much as crack it.
An' chandeliers, all over danglers like earrings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
suh. For all they ain't got such a
sight o' money as they had, Miss Eve,
she's got a real knack at fixin' up, an'
she's travelled Nawth, an' got all the new
ideas. You must 'a' met Miss Eve when
she was Nawth, Mr. Townsend. Why,
suh, she's the beauty o' three counties;
nobody could pass <i>her</i> in a crowd, or out
of it."</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> met Miss Carlyle, Claggett,"
Vance said, growing uncomfortable at the
recollection. "But only once, and for a
moment. As you say, she is a beautiful
young woman."</p>

<p>"Then you <i>will</i> stop at the Hall, suh?"
pleaded his guide.</p>

<p>"No," said Vance, briefly. "We will
go on to Glenwood, and sleep there at the
inn. To-morrow, you shall show me as
much of the country as I have enjoyed
to-day, but I am here for travelling, and
not to cultivate acquaintance, understand."</p>

<p>"Up yonder, on the hill-top, suh,"
observed Mr. Claggett, ignoring rebuke,
"when we git through this little village
we're comin' to (I was in a red-hot skirmish
once, right in the middle of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
street, ahead, suh), is a tree we call the
Big Poplar. It marks the junction of
three counties, an' 'twas there George
Washin'ton slept, when he was on his
surveyin' tour as a boy, suh&mdash;you've
heard of General Washin'ton up your
way, Mr. Townsend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, confound you," said Vance,
laughing at his sly look.</p>

<p>"General Lee halted at that point to
look at the country round, on his way to
Gettysburg. A great friend of Colonel
Carlyle was the General, suh; you'll see a
fine picture of the General in the dinin'-room
at the Hall. Colonel Carlyle lost
two brothers followin' Lee into battle, suh,
but we call that an honor down here.
They do say little Miss Eve keeps the old
swords and soldier caps of them two
uncles in a sort o' altar in her chamber,
suh. Heard the news that Miss Eve's
engaged to her cousin, Mr. Ralph Corbin,
in Wash'n't'n, suh? It's all over the
country, I reckon. He's a young archytec',
an' doin' well; but down here nobody
knows if a young lady's engaged for sure,
till the day's set for the weddin'."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>At this point Vance interrupted his garrulous
guide to suggest that they should
seek refreshment for man and beast in the
hamlet close at hand; and the diversion
this created turned Claggett from the
apparently inexhaustible subject of the
Carlyles.</p>

<p>They rode onward, the genial sun, as
it mounted higher in the heaven, serving
to irradiate, not overheat, the beautiful
earth.</p>

<p>From this point the road went creeping
up, by gentle degrees, to the summit of
the mountain, beyond which Shenandoah
cleft their way in twain. Traversing
Ashby's Gap, the efflorescence of the
woods, the music of many waters, the
balm of purest air, confirmed Vance's
satisfaction in his choice of an expedition.
Descending the steep grade to the river,
they crossed the classic stream upon the
most primitive of flat ferry-boats, and on
the further side passed almost at once into
a rich, agricultural country, upon a well-kept
turnpike, where the horses trotted
rapidly ahead.</p>

<p>Claggett, strange to say, did not resume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
allusions to the Carlyle family; but upon
reaching a certain cross-road, he ventured
an appealing glance at his employer.</p>

<p>"Turn to the right here, to get a short
cut to Carlyle Hall, suh."</p>

<p>"Where does the left road take us?"
asked Vance, shortly.</p>

<p>"You <i>kin</i> git to Glenwood that way,
Mr. Townsend. But it's a roundabout
way, an' a new road, an' a pretty bad one,
an' it's just in the opposite direction from
Colonel&mdash;"</p>

<p>Vance answered him by riding to the
left.</p>

<p>A new road, with a vengeance, and one
apparently bottomless, the horses at every
step plunging deeper into clinging, red-clay
mud; but the obstinacy of Vance
kept him riding silently ahead, and the
trooper, with a quizzical look upon his
weather-beaten face, followed. Miles,
traversed in this fashion, brought them
into the vicinity of a small gathering of
houses, at sight of which Vance spoke for
the first time in an hour.</p>

<p>"Claggett."</p>

<p>"Yes, suh?" This, deferentially.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>"If I ever go back of my own free will
over that infernal piece of road"&mdash;he
paused for a sufficiently strong expression.</p>

<p>"Yes, suh?" said Claggett, expectantly.</p>

<p>"You may write me down an ass."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>suh</i>," Claggett exclaimed, with
what Vance thought a trifle too much
alacrity. "Better let me go befo' you for
a little piece, Mr. Townsend," added the
countryman. "Just where the road slopes
down to the crick, here, it's sorter treacherous,
if you don't know the best bit."</p>

<p>Vance, choosing to be deaf, kept in
front. He traversed the creek in safety;
but, in ascending the other side, his horse
plunged knee-deep into a quagmire,&mdash;throwing
his rider, who arose none the
worse except for a plaster of red mud,&mdash;and
emerged evidently lamed.</p>

<p>"He's all right, suh, excep' for a little
strain," said the ex-trooper, after his experienced
eye and hand had passed over
Merrylad's injuries.</p>

<p>"We will go at once to the hotel in
the village, and get quarters for the night,"
said Vance, ruefully. "I've a change of
clothes in that bag you carry, so I don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
mind for myself. But I wouldn't have
Merrylad the worse for this for anything."</p>

<p>"The trouble is, Mr. Townsend," answered
Claggett, "that you may get quarters
fit for a horse here, but you won't be
stoppin' yourself, I'll tell you."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Come along! You lead
Merrylad; I'm glad to stretch my legs by
a walk," and the young man started off at
a good pace, plashing ever through liquid
mire, that overflowed street and so-called
sidewalk.</p>

<p>There was no sign of an inn of any
kind. A few dilapidated houses of the
poorest straggled on either side the street,
at the end of which they came upon a
country store and post-office combined.
Three or four mud-splashed horses hitched
to a rock; as many mud-splashed loungers
upon tilted chairs on the platform before
the door. That was all.</p>

<p>"Better take 'em on to old Josey's,
Charley," called out a friendly voice to
Claggett.</p>

<p>"Yes, old Josey will do the correct
thing by them," remarked a full-bearded,
sunburned gentleman, who, seated astride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
of a mule, now came "clopping" toward
them through the mud, from the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>"I am really afraid, Mr. Townsend,"
Claggett said, persuasively, "that we shall
be forced to go on a mile or so further, to
old Josey's."</p>

<p>"And who in the thunder <i>is</i> old Josey?"
exclaimed Vance, testily.</p>

<p>"Never heard o' him up Nawth, suh?"
answered the trooper, with a twinkle in
his eye. "He's the big person o' this
part,&mdash;an old bachelor,&mdash;Mr. Joseph
Lloyd, who runs the best farms and raises
the best stock in the neighborhood. The
truth is, not many visitors come here, unless
they are booked for Mr. Lloyd's."</p>

<p>"What claim have I on him, unless I
can pay my night's lodging and yours? I
will leave you and the lame horse here,
and make my way back to-night to Glenwood."</p>

<p>"To get to Glenwood, you'd have to
pass over right smart of that mire we came
through," said Claggett, pensively.</p>

<p>"Then, in Heaven's name, let us go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
to Josey's," said Vance, laughing, in spite
of his bad humor.</p>

<p>They bade farewell to the village, and
went off as they had come, Vance choosing
to walk, the trooper leading the lame
horse.</p>

<p>And now, in defiance of his plight, his
melancholy appearance, the accident to his
favorite, Vance yielded himself to the spell
of a region that became at every moment,
as he advanced, more wildly beautiful.
The sun, about to set, sent a flood of radiance
over hills high and low, over a broken
rolling country dominated by the massive
shaft of Massanutton Mountain, rising like
a tower above his lesser brethren. That
the "mile or two further on" stretched
into four or five, the young man cared not
a jot. His lungs filling with crisp, invigorating
air, he strode forward, and was
almost sorry when the dormer-windows of
an old house shrouded by locust-trees in
bloom appeared upon a plateau across
intervening fields.</p>

<p>"Now for my best cheek!" he said to
himself. "What <i>am</i> I to say to old Josephus?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Ask for lodging, like the tramp
I look? Hang it! I believe I'll sleep
under the nearest haystack, rather!"</p>

<p>While thus absorbed, Mr. Theodore
Vance Townsend, the fine flower of various
clubs, did not perceive that he was an
object of varying interest and solicitude to
three persons looking over the fence of
a pasture near-by, where cattle were
enclosed.</p>

<p>Two elderly gentlemen surveyed him
closely. A girl, who had tossed a glance
at him over her shoulder, seemed to find
more attraction in the Alderney heifer,
whose saucy rough tongue was at that
moment stretched out to lick salt from a
velvet palm, than in the mud-stained wayfarer.</p>

<p>"That's no common tramp," said one
of the gentlemen to the other. "If you
will stay here with my Lady-love, I'll
just go and investigate his case."</p>

<p>Vance Townsend had, perhaps, like
other mortals, known his "bad moments"
in life. But he felt that there had been
few like this, when the old gentleman,
issuing through a gate opening from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
pasture, came to him with a quick, decided
step.</p>

<p>The younger man took off his hat.
The older did likewise. And then Vance,
between a laugh and a groan, told his
story, confirmed by the apparition at that
moment, in the distance, of the horses and
Claggett, who was himself afoot.</p>

<p>"Say no more, my dear fellow, say not
another word," interrupted the astonished
old gentleman. "My name is Lloyd, and
I'm the owner of that house behind the
locusts, where I'm delighted to take you
in, and Charley Claggett, too. We'll find
out what's the matter with your horse,
quick enough. Welcome to Wheatlands,
sir, and just come along with me."</p>

<p>Before Vance fairly knew how, he
found himself in a "prophet's chamber,"
looking upon a sloping roof, where a martin
was nesting within reach of his hand.
Tapping the panes of the upper sash of
his window, a branch tasselled with sweet-smelling
blossoms swayed in the breeze.
Outside, he had a wide and glorious view
of field and mountains. Inside, he possessed
a clean, if homely, bedroom, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
door of which a soft-voiced negro woman
was already knocking, to ask for his bespattered
garments.</p>

<p>Vance was delighted. When he furthermore
found left at his portal a tub
with a large bucket of ice-cold water from
the spring, together with his bag, he began
to think that Virginia hospitality was
not to be relegated among things traditional.</p>

<p class="p2">The soft Virginia dusk was closing upon
the scene, when our young man, leaving
his room, went down-stairs, through a hall
hung with trophies and implements of sport,
and out of an open door upon the "front
porch," to look at the evening star hanging
above the mountain crest. In this
occupation he found another person indulging
likewise, and in the clear gloom discovered
the face and figure of a young and
singularly graceful girl, who without hesitation
accosted him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lloyd has told us of your mishap,"
she said, courteously. "He is congratulating
himself that it happened near
enough to let him help you out of it. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
hope the horse will fare as well as the master."</p>

<p>"Merrylad will be all right, thank you,
so Claggett has been up to tell me. It
appears that Mr. Lloyd, in addition to his
other attractions, is a famous amateur
vet."</p>

<p>"You will find he has all the virtues,"
she said, laughing. At that moment, a
lamp, lighted by the servant in the hall,
sent a stream of illumination upon them.
To Townsend's utter surprise, he saw the
face of his cousin, Evelyn Carlyle.</p>

<p>"You!" he heard her say, in a not too
well pleased tone; and "You?" he
repeated, with what he felt to be not a distinguished
success.</p>

<p>"How extraordinary that it should turn
out to be you!" she began again, first of
the two to recover her composure. "Did
you think&mdash;were you, that is, on your
way to visit <i>us</i>?"</p>

<p>"Nothing was further from my
thoughts," he answered, bluntly. "I, on
the contrary, believed myself to be going
in the opposite direction from where you
live."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," she said, somewhat
piqued. "It is impossible you should have
known that papa and I came yesterday on
a visit to dear old Cousin Josephus. I
beg your pardon if I was very rude."</p>

<p>"It is certainly not a welcome that
seems inspired by what I have been led
to think is Virginia cordiality," he answered,
coolly.</p>

<p>"But I have asked your pardon, and
that's not the way to answer me. You
might grant it, never so stiffly; and after
that, we, being thrown together this way
through no fault of either of us, might
agree to be decently civil before papa,
who can have no idea how I feel toward&mdash;I
mean what my reasons are for feeling&mdash;well,
never mind what I mean,"
she ended, vexed at his immobility.</p>

<p>"I quite join with you in thinking it
would be very silly to take any one else
into this armed neutrality of ours. I shall
at the earliest moment, to-morrow, relieve
you of my presence. Suppose, until then,
you try to treat me as you would another
unoffending man under my circumstances."</p>

<p>"Yes. You are right. It would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
better, and it would not worry papa and
Cousin Josephus," she said, reflectively.
"Well, then, if you were another man, I
should begin by asking you what brought
you to Virginia. No; that would not
be at all polite, would it? I think I shall
just say nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Not till you let me assure you that I
came because a fellow I know told me he
had made a driving tour in this part, last
year, with his wife, and had found it
rather nice&mdash;and another reason was,
that I wanted to get away from myself."</p>

<p>"You are very flattering to our State,"
she said, bridling her head after a fashion
he found both comical and sweet. She
was silent a little while, then resumed,
more gently:</p>

<p>"I was thinking of what you last said,
and maybe I have done you an injustice.
Maybe you are to be pitied more than
blamed."</p>

<p>"Do you mean because I spoiled a
good suit of clothes and hurt my horse's
leg?"</p>

<p>"No; not that. You are clearly not
in need of sympathy. There! They are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
going to ring the supper-bell, and you
must go and be introduced to my father,
as his cousin. He is the dearest daddy in
the world, and will be sure to try to make
you come to visit us at the Hall."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand this is a hint not
to accept?"</p>

<p>"I <i>could</i> stay on here, you know," she
said, in a businesslike way.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly exasperating," he
exclaimed, and then the summons came
to go into the house. Just before they
crossed the threshold, she appeared to have
undergone another change of mind.
Turning back swiftly, in a voice of exceeding
sweetness she breathed into his ear
these words:</p>

<p>"Please, I am sorry. I ought not to
keep forgetting, ought I, that you are a
stranger within our gates, and a cousin,
really?"</p>

<p>"Is she a coquette?" Vance began to
ask himself, but was interrupted by a
<i>sortie</i> of his host in search of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>Vance Townsend had reckoned
without his host when he made the
declaration that he would relieve Miss
Carlyle of his presence the following day.
The kind owner of Wheatlands, indulgent
to every man and beast upon his premises,
had yet a way of holding on to and controlling
guests that none might resist.</p>

<p>Vance, however, did not try very hard
to resist the invitation to stay at least until
"Thursday, when the Carlyles would be
running away home." An evening spent
with the kind, simple, yet cultivated people
who formed the little <i>coterie</i> at Wheatlands
(there was among them a widowed
cousin with her unruly boy, and a cousin
who had been unfortunate in his investments)
had, somehow, quite upset our
hero's notions upon many points.</p>

<p>Claggett, dismissed with a <i>douceur</i>, the
liberality of which consoled that worthy
countryman for an early reunion with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the lady who would not allow him to
tell stories of the war, took an affectionate
leave of his employer. In his manner
Vance detected more satisfaction in
the vindication of Virginia customs than
regret at the severance of their relation.
The little triumph Claggett might readily
have derived from the incident of the wayfarer's
meeting, in spite of himself, with
his relations was heroically suppressed.
And before Townsend had turned upon
his pillow the morning after his arrival, a
telegram had gone to the town where his
luggage had been left, ordering it to be
sent by train that day.</p>

<p>Vance had been told that breakfast
would be at nine; and, awakened at half-past
seven by a bird on the bough in his
window, he abandoned himself to a lazy
review of his impressions of the family.
Of his Cousin Eve he had seen little more
than what has already been told. After
filling her place at a bounteous supper-table,
where the talk was chiefly absorbed
by the three gentlemen, she had vanished,
in company with the widowed cousin, and
was invisible thereafter&mdash;the men sitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
together till midnight in the large, raftered
hall, with a fire in its wide chimney, that
served the old bachelor for a general living-room.</p>

<p>Vance could not remember to have
seen a face of finer lines, a manner of
finer courtesy, than that of his seventy-year-old
host, who, in spite of the rust of
desuetude in worldly ways, carried his
inbred gentility where all who approached
him might profit by it.</p>

<p>That he was a politician went without
saying; and, indeed, the talk once directed
in the channel of national government had
kept there until they separated. On a
claw-footed table holding a lamp beside
Mr. Lloyd's easy chair, covered with
frayed haircloth, Vance saw lying a crisp
new Review of English publication, and
all about were piled newspapers and magazines,
while shelves displayed row upon
row of the antique, tawny volumes that
had made up the complete library of a
country gentleman in the days of old Josephus's
grandfather.</p>

<p>Around the hearth, coming and going
with every opening of many doors, gathered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
dogs of fine and varied breeds. One
old patriarch of a St. Bernard, who attached
himself particularly to the stranger,
had remained close to Vance's feet,
and gravely escorted him to bed.</p>

<p>In his kinsman, Guy Carlyle, a handsome
man of fifty odd years, who in a
military youth had been noted for deeds of
daring that rang through the army of
Northern Virginia, but had long since
resigned himself to the peaceful pursuits
of agriculture, Vance saw the origin of
Eve's rare beauty. He also became
aware that, of a large family of sons and
daughters born to the now widowed Colonel,
Eve was the sole survivor; and it did
not need the expression that irradiated her
father's face when her name was touched
upon to show in what estimation she was
held by him.</p>

<p>The tinge of melancholy in Mr. Carlyle's
manner had, however, no effect like
repression of the cordial friendliness he
extended to the newcomer. Vance had
gone to rest with a feeling that he had
conferred a genuine favor upon his two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
elders by according to them, as he had,
his company.</p>

<p>Spite of these conditions of good-fellowship,
he awoke next morning conscious
that there was one under the roof
with him who had the power (and no desire
to withhold it) to make him far from
comfortable; to puzzle him, to banter
him, to pull him up with a jerk at the
moment he might feel that he was getting
reasonably ahead with her; to punish him,
it would appear, for some offence he could
not own to having committed.</p>

<p>It was very clear that Eve thought him
a poor fellow, mentally and morally; that,
apart from her specific grudge against him,
of nature unknown, she was not in the
least inclined to pay tribute to his position,
fashion, culture, wealth,&mdash;the appendages
of Vance Townsend's personality people
around him had always been disposed to
make so much of. In the firmament of
American society, he took himself to be
a planet of first importance. In other
lands, he had enjoyed more than a reasonable
share of social success. Why should
he here, for the first time in his life, feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
like a man coming in fancy costume to a
dinner where all the other guests wore
plain clothes?</p>

<p>It must be the doing of that girl. She
it was who, with a few words, a cool
glance or two that appeared to read his
soul, had brought him into this strait; and
Vance was still young enough to feel himself
flame with resentment of her. Then
fell upon his mental ear the soft cadence
of her voice, asking his pardon for having
possibly misjudged him, and his anger
passed.</p>

<p>As from Eve he went on to think of
Kitty Ainger, now Mrs. Crawford, Vance
was surprised at the freedom from soreness
the reflection left upon his mind.
Mrs. Crawford, he even reflected, was
really an admirable woman&mdash;just the wife,
as everybody had said, for a rising fellow
like Crawford, who would surely reach
the top! She had shown her good sense in
taking him. Was it possible Vance had
ever thought anything else?</p>

<p>On a table near the bed lay the contents
of a pocket emptied overnight&mdash;among
them a folded paper, inscribed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the latest and most satisfactory draft of
his verses to Kitty. This he now seized,
and, upon re-reading it, a flush that was
not of tender consciousness overspread his
face. Regardless of the loss to the world
of poetry, ignoring the recurrent efforts
that Calliope had witnessed, he deliberately
tore it up, and went to the open window
prepared to scatter the tiny remnants
upon a matin breeze.</p>

<p>A view of wide green plains, with here
and there a clump of noble trees, of soaring
blue hills beyond them, all shining in
the morning sun, met his eye; and almost
directly beneath his window were a couple
of horses, of which one was bestridden
by old Josephus, in a nankeen coat and
venerable Panama hat; the other, little
more than a colt, was held by a negro and
saddled for a woman's use.</p>

<p>"Lady-love! Lady-love, I say!" called
out the old gentleman, in a voice of
Stentor.</p>

<p>"Coming, coming, come!" gaily answered
somebody; and in a moment
Vance's Cousin Eve appeared.</p>

<p>Springing lightly upon the segment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
an enormous tree that served as horse-block,
she dropped into her saddle, and
devoted herself to subduing the juvenile
remonstrance of her steed.</p>

<p>With the fragments of his effusion to
Kitty Ainger still in hand, Vance felt a
curious sensation, as though the old world
had suddenly become young and beautiful
and tuneful; and then, from his ambush,
he heard Josephus say:</p>

<p>"I'd half a mind to rouse up our visitor,
and take him with us to see the sheep
in Six-Acre Lot. The ride before breakfast
would have given him a good idea of
the way my land lies."</p>

<p>"O Cousin Josey, I am so thankful
you did <i>not</i>!" answered Eve, with sincerity
unmistakable.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, my dear child," began Mr.
Lloyd, rebukingly; but Eve, who just then
succeeded in starting her colt in the right
direction, was off and away, sending back
a trill of laughter to her ancient cavalier,
who made good speed to follow her.</p>

<p>The new conviction of his folly in having
agreed to remain under the same shelter
with Miss Carlyle did not prevent Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Townsend from making his appearance
with an excellent appetite at the breakfast-table,
whither he was duly escorted by
Bravo, the old dog he had found outside
his bedroom door waiting to take him in
charge.</p>

<p>With Bravo and another dog or two at
heel, Vance had walked off his pique over
dew-washed slopes of short, rich grass to
a summit near the house, to be joined on
the return by Colonel Carlyle, who had
strolled out to meet him.</p>

<p>Breakfasts at Wheatlands were justly
considered the <i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i> of old Josey's
cook. Vance, helping himself to quickly
succeeding dainties seen for the first time,
cast a mental glance backward to the egg
and a cup of tea that formed his accustomed
meal at home. Half-way in the
repast, Eve, who had been changing her
habit to a pretty cotton gown, slipped into
place between her father and the widow,
who was pouring out the coffee.</p>

<p>"What! What!" said Cousin Josey,
detecting her absence from a seat at his
side, that would have brought her face to
face with Townsend. "My Lady-love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
desert me like that? Come back, little
runaway, and see your Cousin Vance taste
his first mouthful of a Wheatlands ham!"</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Eve could but take the
seat indicated; and Vance, who had determined
to be no longer oppressed by so
small and pink a person, bestowed on her
an openly admiring glance that angered
her anew.</p>

<p>"We must leave you to Eve's mercies
this morning, Mr. Townsend," observed
their host, at the conclusion of the repast.
"Carlyle and I have promised to ride over
to the County Court to hear a case tried,
and to call on the Judge, who is an old
college chum of the Colonel's. We shall
be home to dinner at two, and you young
people must entertain each other until
then."</p>

<p>"Could you not manage not to show
so plainly what you feel?" asked Vance
in his cousin's little ear, as they left the
table. "Pray believe that I am not a
party to the infliction put upon you."</p>

<p>They had strolled bareheaded out under
the trees shading the lawn about the house.</p>

<p>"Shall we never have done quarrelling?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
said Eve, wearily. "Just as I think I
begin to feel kindly toward you, something
happens, and I break down again."</p>

<p>"Were we not moderately successful
last night, when I assumed to be somebody
else?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; that is better. I will treat you
as I would any other man stopping here&mdash;any
one not of your exalted class, I mean."</p>

<p>"That was a quite unnecessary taunt.
But I will allow it to pass if you agree for
to-day&mdash;until the gentlemen return&mdash;to
treat me as you would Mr. Ralph Corbin,
for example."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked,
quickly. "Ralph is the dearest, most
obliging cousin I have, and I impose upon
him dreadfully. If he were here, I should
begin by sending him indoors to fetch my
hat and parasol from the hall rack, and a
new magazine I left in the window-seat,
and tell him to call the dogs to come with
us&mdash;What! <i>you</i> can't intend to condescend
to wait upon a mere girl, a country
cousin?"</p>

<p>He was off and back again with the
articles demanded, showing no enmity in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the smile offered with them to her acceptance.
But he did not at once surrender
the periodical, or until he had satisfied himself
of the contents of the page held open
by a marker of beaten silver.</p>

<p>"You don't mind my looking at what
you read?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If you like. It is some verses&mdash;<i>not</i>
what <i>you</i> would care for, in the least, but
they have given me great pleasure."</p>

<p>A glance showed him that his suspicion
was correct. The stanzas in question
had been written by him some months
before, and sent, unsigned, to the editor.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what you fancy in
these?" he said, with fine indifference of
manner.</p>

<p>"Why does one like a flower, or worship
a star? They suit me, I suppose,
and I am learning them by heart."</p>

<p>His own heart throbbed with a schoolboy's
glee and pride. But he said nothing,
and walked beside her light figure, in
the round of garden and orchard, bringing
up in the stable-yard. Here, a space
paved with grass-grown cobblestones was
bounded on three sides by frame structures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
now, in their decay, as gray and as fragile-looking
as hornets' nests.</p>

<p>"And the little house built of limestone,
with one window, was put up in
Colonial days, for refuge in case of an
Indian raid. Mr. Lloyd will tell you one
of his best stories, about an adventure of
his ancestor in there, when three white
men successfully resisted a band of red-skins.
Perhaps our aboriginal anecdotes
would bore you, however. If so, give us
only a little hint, and we desist. Now,
shan't we go in and see your horses?"</p>

<p>She lifted the latch; Vance followed her,
past stalls where the occupants gave her
immediate recognition, to those in which
his own pair were comfortably ensconced.
Merrylad, ungallant fellow, would have
none of the young lady, but at the touch
and voice of his master, turned his beautiful
head sidewise to lay it upon Vance's
shoulder with affection.</p>

<p>"I am, at last, an illustration of the
legend, 'Some one to love me,'" he said,
laughing. "So you thought I had forsaken
you, old man? Not I, my beauty.
Gently, gently, you are too demonstrative."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't imagine life without horses
and dogs; can you?" she said, with the
quickly growing comradeship of a child.
"There; I was determined that Merrylad
should let me stroke his neck!"</p>

<p>From the stables, whose inmates seemed
to have put them upon a better footing,
they passed again under the pink-blossomed
arcades of an apple-orchard, to
pause beside a curious indentation, like a
dimple, in the turf.</p>

<p>"Just here," began Evelyn,&mdash;"but I
shall not tell you, unless you promise to
be properly impressed,&mdash;a sad fate overcame
a dishonest negro servant of Mr.
Lloyd's ancestor. He&mdash;the servant, I
mean&mdash;was a fellow much given to acrobatic
feats, and was accustomed to divert
his master's guests by tumbling and turning
cart-wheels. One day, he robbed
old Mr. Lloyd's money-chest, and filling
his pockets, went out in the orchard, and
testified his glee by standing on his head."</p>

<p>"What happened? Evidently something
of a supernatural nature."</p>

<p>"The earth opened, and out came a
great hairy red hand," said Eve, "(I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
telling it to you as my nurse told it to me)
and 'cotched him by de hayde, and drawed
him down.'"</p>

<p>"What evidence do they offer of this
event?"</p>

<p>"That is the thrilling part. About
fifty years ago, when the present owner
was just of age, some men at work in
this place dug up a treasure of golden
'cob-coins,' clipped here and there to regulate
their value, as the custom was in
olden days. And there, wedged in the
earth where the gold lay scattered, was
the skeleton of a man standing upon his
head!"</p>

<p>"Proof positive," said Vance, laughing.</p>

<p>"I thought I should convince you. As
an actual fact, the coins brought six hundred
dollars at the Philadelphia mint,
and the money was distributed among the
finders."</p>

<p>"Imagine how many darkeys have
stolen out here, since, to work at night
with pick and shovel! I suppose that
accounts for the depression of the sod."</p>

<p>"I myself found a George II. coin in
the garden yesterday. See! If I were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
give it to you, do you think it would bind
you to continue to be 'some one else,'
during the rest of your stay with us?"</p>

<p>He took the bit of copper she held out,
wondering, as he had done the night
before, whether this kindly mood meant
coquetry, then deciding it was but the
frolic spirit of a wholesome and untrammelled
youth not to be restrained. Whatever
it meant, he would profit by it. A
creature so bright, so impulsive as this,
his new-found cousin, was not within his
ken, even if the occasional prick of her
wit did keep him in an attitude of self-defence.</p>

<p>"Her cheeks are true apple-blossoms,"
he found himself murmuring, irrelevantly,
as he pursued her through the tunnel of
orchard boughs. "But her lips&mdash;what?
Ah! bard beloved, I thank you&mdash;'Her
mouth a crimson flower.' That's it.
'Her mouth a crimson flower.'"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, back
there?" exclaimed his guide, turning
sharply to call him to account.</p>

<p>"Did I speak aloud? I was&mdash;ah&mdash;only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
wondering where we are going to
bring up?"</p>

<p>"Do I tire you? Perhaps you are not
used to walking. Never mind; we shall
soon reach the graveyard, and then you
can sit upon the stone wall and rest."</p>

<p>"I think I can last to the graveyard,"
meekly said the young man, whose tramps
in the Alps and Dolomites and Rockies
had included of "broken records" not a
few.</p>

<p>"Now, you are laughing at me," she
said, suspiciously. "But you know I have
never heard of you except as a lounger in
clubs and a leader of <i>cotillons</i>."</p>

<p>Vance thought it useless to protest.</p>

<p>They now reached an enclosure under
a grove of maples, where, motioning him
to sit upon a low wall tapestried with moss
and fern and creepers, she perched upon
the gnarled root of a tree, and, opening
her book, prepared to become absorbed
in it.</p>

<p>"Suppose you read aloud to me," he
suggested, with cunning aforethought.</p>

<p>"This?" she said, doubtfully, surveying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
his verses. "Oh, no; I think not.
You would hardly care for <i>this</i>. It is
something quite out of your line, don't
you see? The writer gives expression to
a perfectly straightforward, yet eloquent,
expression of a true man's true feeling,
about a thing of every day. It is not only
that the words are lovely and the sentiment
is noble, but the measure ripples like a
stream&mdash;Why, what is the matter with
you? One would think you know the
author."</p>

<p>"I am afraid, upon reflection, that I <i>do
not</i> know the author," he said, drawing
back into his shell.</p>

<p>"If you did, I should get you to thank
him for me for this," she resumed.
"They say authors are always disappointing
to meet, after one has idealized them
through their writings. But <i>he</i> would not
be. No; I would trust him, through
everything, to be a noble gentleman. Of
course he is unworldly. I believe he lives
in a remote Territory, and despises petty
conventionalities of society, especially those
in New York. And I think he never even
heard of that dreadful 400 of yours."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>Vance, smiling at her girlish nonsense,
felt himself, nevertheless, lapped in the
Elysium of her speech.</p>

<p>Then her mood changed to pathos, as
she told him the story of "Cousin Josey's"
single episode of love, ending in the mound
beside them, where slept the old man's
bride-betrothed of seventeen,&mdash;a ward of
his mother,&mdash;who had died of a tragic
accident, forty years agone.</p>

<p>"And every day, since, he has come
here. See, there are fresh wood-violets
upon her breast. And the dear old man
has never thought of such a thing as giving
her a successor. Now, let us go.
There are lambs to show you, and a lot
of other things."</p>

<p>The passing cloud was gone from her
April face. She was again radiant, and in
some bedazzlement of mind he arose and
followed her.</p>

<p class="p2">Townsend's acquaintance with his Virginia
cousins had, as might have been
expected, prolonged itself into a visit to
Carlyle Hall; and he was on the eve of
departure, after a stay of two weeks in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
that delightful refuge, before he realized
how much his fancy had begun to twine
around the place and its inmates.</p>

<p>Sentiment for the young creature who
was its ruling spirit he did not admit, other
than the natural tribute of his age and sex
to hers. Nor did he give her credit for
more than temporary feeling on any point
disconnected with her strong local attachments.
Her father, her home, and those
she grandiosely called her "people"&mdash;meaning,
he supposed, the individuals indebted
to Providence for having been born
within the limits of her State&mdash;were the
objects of Eve's warm affection.</p>

<p>Vance felt sure her courteous thought
of him was the result of only transmitted
consideration for a guest. So soon as he
should quit the pleasant precincts of the
Hall, he feared he must put aside his claim
to even this consideration. This condition
of affairs worried our young man more
than he cared to admit to himself. To no
one else would he have confessed that the
fortnight had been spent by him in a daily
effort to impress upon her a personality
widely different from her conception of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Now, at the end of his enterprise, he was
conscious that he had not advanced in the
endeavor; and this last evening in her
company was correspondingly depressing
to his <i>amour propre</i>.</p>

<p>They were sitting together in a window-seat
of the drawing-room, looking
into an old-world garden with box walks,
a sun-dial, and a blaze of tulips piercing
the brown mold. From the western sky,
facing them, the red light was vanishing,
and in the large, dim room a couple of
lamps made islands of radiance in a sea of
shadows. In the library, adjoining, sat
the Colonel, reading, his strong, handsome
head seen in profile from where they were.</p>

<p>Sounds of evening in the country, the
sweet whistle of a negro in the distance,
alone broke the spell of silence brooding
over the old house. Vance hesitated to
further disturb it, the more so that Evelyn
had been in a mood of unusual graciousness.
Nor did he, in truth, feel prepared
to broach the discussion of certain things
he had put off until now.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he said at last, with a
genuine sigh, "I shall be on my way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
northward, and this beautiful, restful life
will be among my has-beens."</p>

<p>"Too restful, I'm afraid," she cried, in
her brusque, schoolgirl fashion. "Your
Aunt Myrtle always speaks of Virginia as
nothing but a 'cure,' which she is clearly
glad to have accomplished and lived
down."</p>

<p>"It has been a cure for me in another
sense. I wonder if you know what you
have done for me?"</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't fence with me now.
For once, believe in your cousin, who is,
after this, going to leave you for a long
time in peace. Tell me; when I shall
have gone, and that big, comfortable
'spare room' is put in order again for the
next guest, shall you sometimes think of
the subject of your missionary labors in
the past two weeks?"</p>

<p>"But I have never undertaken to
reform you," she said, in a vexed tone.
"It is absurd for you to think I imagined
myself capable of that. The best I could
hope for was that your visit should pass
without our coming to open conflict.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Papa could tell you I promised him to try
that this should be so."</p>

<p>"Then I am indebted to your father
for the modicum of personal consideration
you have vouchsafed me?"</p>

<p>"And Cousin Josey&mdash;yes," she answered,
with startling candor. "At the
same time, I must say, I like you now
better than I believed I ever could. It
makes me wish with all my heart I could
trust you."</p>

<p>Vance felt a sting that was not all
resentment, or all pain. The expression
of her eyes, so fearless, so intense, waked
in him a feeling that, in the moment they
had reached, he desired nothing so much
in all the world as to win this "mere
girl's" approval. The color deepened in
his face, as he said:</p>

<p>"And yet you have given the author of
those verses, who happens to be myself,
credit for something in which you could
place faith?"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;<i>you</i>?" she exclaimed, starting
violently. "Ah no! Don't destroy my
ideals."</p>

<p>"This may be wholesome, but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
certainly not pleasant," he said, praying
Heaven for patience.</p>

<p>There was nothing of her customary
light spirit of bravado in the manner in
which, after a pause, she next spoke to
him.</p>

<p>"I hardly know how&mdash;for the sake of
others, I mean, not on my own account&mdash;to
ask if it is possible you have not, in
connection with me, given a thought to
one who was my daily, intimate companion
all of last winter."</p>

<p>"That!" he interrupted, with a dry
laugh. Why not arraign her for the
wreck of me?"</p>

<p>"You understand me, I see," she said,
with meaning. "Let me say this, then:
that I hold a trifler with women's hearts
to be the most despicable of characters.
A man who is too indolent or too infirm
of purpose to deny himself the pleasure
he gets from watching his progress in a
girl's affections is an offender the law
mayn't reach, but he deserves it should.
That he makes his victim old before her
time, in his gradual, refined disappointment
of her hopes, may not count for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
much, in your estimation. But&mdash;but&mdash;oh!
I could not have believed it of the
person who wrote those verses!"</p>

<p>There were tears in her honest eyes, a
tremor in her young voice. Save for
these, Vance, who had walked away from
her a dozen steps, would have continued
to put distance between himself and this
"angel at the gate."</p>

<p>As it was, he controlled himself sufficiently
to return and say, in a hard,
strained voice:</p>

<p>"I shall not attempt to change your
estimate of me. But I am glad you have
given me an opportunity to tell you that
on the day I saw you first, I went directly
from my aunt's house to ask Katherine
Ainger to be my wife. Some day, when
you are older, and know more of the
world, and take broader views of poor
humanity, all these things may seem to
you different. Then you may, perhaps,
admit that, with all my faults, I could
never be such a cad as you have pictured.
In the little time that we are together
now, please, let us say no more about it."</p>

<p>He walked away, joining the Colonel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
to engage that unsuspecting gentleman in
an exhaustive discussion of politics.</p>

<p>Eve sat for awhile in her dusky corner,
absorbed in thought. She had decided to
say a few words to him, before he should
go, that might contribute to her relief
rather than his. But Vance gave her no
opportunity to speak any words to him,
except those of conventional farewell.
Betimes, next morning, he took leave of
his cousins; and the Virginia episode was
over.</p>

<p>After he had left, Eve locked herself in
her room, and gave way to a burst of
tears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<h3>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>In a railway carriage that had long before
left Genoa with the ultimate intention
of getting into Rome, a girl sat, tranced
in satisfaction, looking from the window,
throughout an afternoon of spring. To
speed thus leisurely between succeeding
pictures of a scenery and life she seemed
to recognize from some prior state of existence&mdash;although
now, in fact, seen for
the first time&mdash;was a joy sufficient to annihilate
fatigue.</p>

<p>The milk-white oxen ploughing the red
fields; the peasant women at work amid
young vines; the sheets of wild flowers;
the pink and white and blue-washed villas,
with their terraces and palms and flower-pots;
the hedges of roses, and groves of
olive and eucalyptus; above all, the classic
names of stations, albeit placarded in a
commonplace way,&mdash;made Miss Evelyn
Carlyle, lately a passenger of a steamer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
arriving at Genoa from America, turn and
twist from side to side of the carriage, and
flush and thrill with satisfaction, after a
fashion causing her father, who accompanied
her, to rejoice that they occupied
their apartment undisturbed.</p>

<p>As evening closed upon the scene, she
at last consented to throw her head back
upon the cushion of the seat, and admit
she was a prey to the mortal consideration
of exceeding hunger. Since leaving
Genoa, a roll and some cakes of chocolate,
only, had supplied the luncheon for
a journey of ten hours. Therefore, when
the train, stopping after dark at a little
buffet, was promptly forsaken by its passengers,
Eve and her father joined the
eager throng craving refreshment at the
hands of a perspiring landlord and his
inefficient aids.</p>

<p>"If I could only make these fellows
understand, perhaps they would stop to
listen," said Colonel Carlyle, growing
wroth at the struggling, vociferating, jostling
crowd massed in a small room,
snatching for food like hungry dogs.</p>

<p>"Allow me to&mdash;By Jove, it's the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Colonel!" said a voice behind him, whose
possessor was trying to pass on.</p>

<p>"Ralph Corbin! Where did you drop
from?" and, "Ralph, this is too delightful"
were the greetings received by
the young man thus unexpectedly encountered.</p>

<p>"I am on my way from Nice to Rome
to meet&mdash;er&mdash;some friends who are
expected there for the Silver Wedding festivities,"
said he, with becoming blushes.</p>

<p>"I know," exclaimed Evelyn, gleefully.
"I was sure they had something
to do with it."</p>

<p>"But it's uncertain whether they have
returned from Greece yet; and it's
awfully jolly to meet you, anyway, Eve,
and the Colonel. Here, let's get some
food, and I'll go in your carriage for the
rest of the way, of course. I'd not an
idea you were coming out this year."</p>

<p>"Nor we, until a fortnight since," said
Eve.</p>

<p>Ralph capturing a supply of bread, and
fruit, and roast chicken, they made off
with their booty to the train, and the evening
passed in merry chat and explanation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
of their plans. Evelyn, however, by no
means lost the consciousness of her advance
for the first time upon Rome; and
when, after crossing the Tiber at midnight,
and catching glimpses, on either
side the railway, of ruins that heralded
their vicinity to the goal of her hopes,
she was keyed to high excitement.</p>

<p>Ralph laughed at her disappointment as
the train ran slowly into a large, modern
station lighted by electricity, and decorated
with hangings of gold and crimson,
a crimson carpet spread across the platform
to one of the doors of exit. When
they enquired of the <i>facchino</i> who took
their bags in charge, what great arrival
was expected, the man answered with an
indifference worthy of democratic New
York: "It is for the Silver Wedding of
their Majesties, Signor; but there are so
many Kings and Emperors and Princes in
Rome now, we have ceased to take
account of them."</p>

<p>"We have struck Rome at a crowded
season," said Ralph, "and I don't know
that you are going to like it overmuch. I
say, Eve, if Somebody doesn't come for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
another week or so, what a heaven-send
you and your father will be to me for
company!"</p>

<p>"That is the most cold-blooded way of
making use of us to kill time with," said
Eve; but she bestowed on him a well-pleased
smile. To her, Ralph had been
ever a chum,&mdash;a dear, good fellow, who
was the best of company. His unexpected
appearance here promised to add tenfold
to her pleasure, while his hopes in the
affair hinted at between them had been,
for some time, familiar to her in detail.</p>

<p>"And all this while I have never told
you," he went on, in his boyish manner,
"that at Nice I fell in with that swell
New York cousin of yours, Vance Townsend.
Not half a bad chap, if he is
rather close-mouthed. Shouldn't wonder
if he's in Rome, now, like everybody
else in this part of the world."</p>

<p>"Townsend?" said the Colonel, with
animation. "Glad to hear there's a
chance of seeing him. Just a year&mdash;isn't
it, Eve?&mdash;since he visited us at the Hall.
Well, there's no doubt we are in luck, if
we meet Vance as well as you, Ralph."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>"The funny part of it is," whispered
the joyous Ralph to Evelyn, "some of the
people we both knew in Nice put it into
Townsend's head I was coming here to
meet my <i>fiancée</i>. And you know, Eve, I
am not engaged to her yet; her mother
put us on probation for six months. The
six months are out next week, though, and
I don't think it would hurt Maud's mamma
to hurry herself a little bit to get here, do
you? How you will admire Maud's style,
Evie! Her hair is dark as&mdash;" etc., etc.,
until Evelyn cut it short by jumping into
the carriage drawn up in waiting for them.</p>

<p>Just now, she was not as well prepared
to listen as usual. Certain feelings she
had believed extinct proved themselves to
have been merely dormant. Even the
spectacle of Rome <i>en fête</i>, by night, its
bands and fountains playing, its streets
still filled with lively promenaders, did not
wholly distract her from this sudden tumult
of an emotion she was not prepared
to define.</p>

<p>Constantly, during the crowded days
that followed, while they drove hither and
thither, attracted but provoked by the jumbling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
of ancient and modern in these
haunts of history, she tried to persuade
herself she was not ever on the alert to
see somebody who did not appear. For,
from among the many acquaintances and
a few friends encountered in the streets of
the sociable little city, Vance was persistently
missing.</p>

<p>Ralph, however, whose sweetheart also
kept her distance, proved his philosophy
by devoting his days to the Carlyles; and
thus, under a sky blue as the fabled Elysian
fields of Virgil, the festal week went
on. Wherever their Majesties of Italy
and Germany passed in public, they were
greeted by thoroughfares black with people,
windows and balconies blazing with
flags and draperies, the clash of bands and
the clank of soldiery.</p>

<p>The coachman engaged for the service
of our friends would contrive, wherever
bound, to take on the way some passing
show of sovereigns; and, upon a certain
fair day, for no reason avowed, he drove
them into the tangle of vehicles and people
always seen surrounding the doors of
the Quirinal Palace whenever there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
chance to catch glimpses of royalties upon
the move. There ensconced, the saucy,
bright-eyed fellow stood up, pretended his
inability to get out of the snarl, gesticulated,
talked to his friends and threatened
his enemies in the crowd, while visibly
rejoicing in the opportunity to see all
likely to occur in that coveted quarter.</p>

<p>"Look here, cabby, if you don't move
out of this to the Baths of Caracalla in
just two minutes and a half," began Ralph,
at last, in emphatic English; but he had
no reason to go on, as the driver, seeing
the young man's face, gathered up the
reins, and extricated himself with much
dexterity from the crowd.</p>

<p>Neither of his passengers noticed that
a gentleman, in a carriage just then crossing
theirs, looked at them, leaned forward,
gave orders to his coachman, and at once
proceeded to follow on their tracks.</p>

<p>In the glorious ruin of the greatest of
temples to athletic exercise, Evelyn drew
a deep breath of delight. Nothing in
Rome, not even the Colosseum, had so
impressed her with the grandeur of bygone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
achievement in architecture as this
wondrous pile, with its vast spaces, the
gray walls breached by Time, out of
which maidenhair grew and crows were
flying&mdash;"crying to heaven for rain," as
the guide poetically explained; the stately
columns of red porphyry grouped around
the beautiful mosaic floors; the lace-like
traceries of carven stone; the niches and
pedestals from which marvels of old sculpture
had been removed; over all, the air
that is gold and balm combined!</p>

<p>Evelyn leaned against a column abstractedly,
while Ralph and her father
walked about, discussing with their guide
facts and statistics of the Thermae. They
had indeed strolled quite out of her sight,
when a shadow on the pavement beside
her caused her to look up. If an answer
to thought be no surprise, then was not
Evelyn surprised; for the person confronting
her was Vance Townsend.</p>

<p>"I have known that you were in Rome
ever since the night you arrived," he said,
without preamble other than coldly offering
her his hand. "I happened to be at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
the station to meet an English friend, when
you came out; and I saw you get into your
carriage and drive away."</p>

<p>"Then you can hardly claim to have
earned a welcome from us, now," she began
to say, lightly, but found it impossible
to go on, checked by the look upon his
face.</p>

<p>"I make no pretences," he said, bitterly.
"If you care to know that I have
either kept you in view every day since, or
else have gone for long rides into the country,
where I saw nobody, it is quite true.
I have done everything foolish, everything
foreign to my principles and habits, to satisfy,
or to get away from, the feeling the
sight of you aroused in me. I wonder
what you'd think, if I told you I've been
wandering about pretty much ever since I
parted with you, a year ago, trying to get
you out of my head. Many's the letter
I've written to you and destroyed. Twice
I set out to see you, and once I got back
into the neighborhood of your home.
When I saw you in the crowd at the station
here, I actually thought I was possessed&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
He checked himself. "I beg
your pardon. I have no right to say these
things to you, I know."</p>

<p>"You? You?" she could only repeat,
bewildered by the meaning in his tone and
the expression of his eyes. "Is it possible
that you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I fell in love with you that time
when you were holding me to account for
a thousand transgressions, committed or not
committed? Yes, it is quite possible. That
need not prevent our remaining good
friends, need it? I hope I've too much
common sense to ask you to indulge in a
discussion of these points, now; during the
past week, I've been engaged continually,
and I trust with some success, in disposing
of the last remnant of hope I may have
cherished that some day things might work
around to give me at least a chance."</p>

<p>"You make me very unhappy," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"That is far from my wish," he said,
more gently. "Just at present you ought
to be walking on roses. There! Your
father and Corbin are coming back this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
way. I want to ask you to help me to
excuse myself in your good father's sight,
if I seem unsociable."</p>

<p>"One word," she said, the blood flaming
into her cheeks. "It is due you to
know that long ago, soon after you left us,
I received a letter from Katherine Crawford,&mdash;a
letter that made me understand
many things I had judged harshly in your
conduct."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Crawford has been always kind
to me," he answered. "And no one rejoices
more than I in her present happiness."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is happy,&mdash;perfectly so,&mdash;and
her life is full of the duties that best
suit her. She says it was all planned out
for her by Providence, and kept in reserve
until she was fit for it."</p>

<p>"So runs the world away!" he exclaimed,
with a whimsical gesture.</p>

<p>After that, the others came, and there
was much talk of the subjects naturally
presenting themselves. When they moved
out of the enclosure to go to the carriage,
Vance walked with the Colonel, following
Evelyn and Ralph.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"You will dine with us at our hotel
this evening?" said the older man, at
parting.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I am engaged," Vance
answered, with appropriate courtesy, "and
that to-morrow I am off for Sicily. Sometime,
later on in your wanderings, I shall
hope to run upon you again. This is the
worst of pleasant meetings in travel, is it
not?"</p>

<p>When they were seated in the victoria,
he shook Evelyn's hand last.</p>

<p class="p2">The day was finally at hand that was to
bring Ralph's sweetheart&mdash;with her incidental
father, mother, two younger sisters,
and a governess&mdash;to the quarters engaged
for them at Rome. In the young man's
enthusiasm, he did not forget to wonder
what cloud had passed over his Cousin
Evelyn's enjoyment of the place, the sights,
the season. He even consulted the Colonel
as to whether Eve might not be unduly affected
by the crowded condition of the
town, and proposed for them to change to
a quieter spot. And Eve's father, who
had had his own anxieties on this point,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
prevailed upon her to give up the engagements
she had made with apparent zest,
and resort to Naples and Sorrento.</p>

<p>To Naples, accordingly, they went, the
faithful Ralph accompanying them, at the
cost of a night-journey on his return to
Rome for the day that was to see his happiness
in flower. He drove with them to
their hotel, through the interminable streets,
lined with palaces and thronged with paupers,
and saw them ensconced in pleasant
quarters facing Vesuvius, whose feather of
smoke pointed to good weather. They
dined together in a vast <i>salle-à-manger</i>,
where, in a gallery, was conducted during
their repast a noisy and mirth-provoking
concert of fiddlers, mandolins, and guitars,&mdash;the
performers singing, shouting, dancing,
as they played. There was an hour
before his train left, in which, while the
Colonel smoked upon the balcony of their
sitting-room, Eve walked out upon one of
the quays with her cousin; and this hour
Ralph determined to improve.</p>

<p>In the last day or two, trifles had shown
this astute young man that the depression
of his cousin (for whom he cherished no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
grudge because, a year or two before, he
had been wild to call her wife, and she
would not hear of it) had been coincident
with the meeting in Rome with Townsend.
That very morning, he had found
at his bankers', had read and put into his
pocket, a letter written by Vance on arriving
at Taormina, which had thrown
upon the subject a new and surprising
light. Just how to convey his discoveries
to Evelyn, the most proud and sensitive
of creatures about her sacred feelings, he
had not yet decided.</p>

<p>They talked of the bay, of the mountains,
of Vesuvius. Calmed and enchanted
by the hour and scene, Eve wore her gentlest
aspect, and Ralph felt emboldened to
begin.</p>

<p>"This is as it should be," he said, with
an air of generalizing. "You will go to
Sorrento and Amalfi and Capri, and your
roses will come back. I shall not forget
you, Evie dear, because I am getting what
I most want in life. You have always
been to me a thing apart, and I've told
Maud so, over and over again. By and
by, I shall bring her to the Hall, and let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
her see you at your best, as its mistress.
For you are not quite the same over here,
Evie, as in Virginia air."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am growing old," she said,
smiling. "But never mind me. We
shall miss you, Ralph, and it will require
the greatest heroism to do without you.
After this journey, nobody need tell me
that 'three is trumpery.' We know better,
do we not?"</p>

<p>"Why not send for your other cousin
to take my place?" said Ralph, seeing his
opportunity. "He is at Taormina, and
would come, undoubtedly. I had a letter
from him this morning, by the way. The
most characteristic letter,&mdash;just like the
man."</p>

<p>No answer. Ralph felt as he were
treading a bridge of glass.</p>

<p>"To explain it, I should have to go
back to the evening of that meeting in
the Baths of Caracalla. He came to me
at the hotel, and after a friendly chat, just
as he was leaving, took occasion to say
some uncommonly nice things about my
relations with (as I thought) <i>Maud</i>; so I
thanked him, and gushed a little about her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
maybe,&mdash;in my circumstances, a fellow's
excusable,&mdash;and off he went, I never suspecting
that he all the time thought I was
going to marry <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>Here Ralph was rewarded by a genuine
start and a blush, but still Eve did not
speak.</p>

<p>"A day later," Ralph went on, determined
now to do or die, "something I
recalled of our conversation made me
realize the mistake he was under, and I
wrote him a letter explaining it. Such a
time as I had to find his whereabouts!
His banker had no instructions to forward
anything, and I won't tell you all the ups
and downs of trying to get at him. Finally,
in despair, I sent the letter, on the
chance, to Taormina, and from there he
answered me."</p>

<p>At this point, in revenge for her indifference,
the diplomatist remained, in his
turn, silent, until Eve, who could bear it
no longer, turned upon him her beautiful
young face, glowing in the evening light
with an eager joy. "And&mdash;and?" she
exclaimed, impetuously.</p>

<p>"He is a good sort&mdash;Townsend,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
went on Ralph, reflectively. "I've an
idea, Evie, that if you and he could have
managed to hit it off, you would have
suited each other capitally. He would be
the kind likely to settle down into a country
gentleman, too; and you would never
be happy in town. He has brains and a
heart, in addition to his good looks and
manners, and a restrained force of character
that would be an excellent balance for
this little impulsive lady, whose only fault
is that she jumps at conclusions instead of
working to them."</p>

<p>"You are perfectly right about that,
Ralph," she said, laughing away a strong
desire to cry. "I am learning wisdom,
however, with rapidly advancing years.
And you do only justice to my Cousin
Vance, in your estimate of him. No
doubt," here she swallowed a nervous
catch in her voice, "if he told the truth
in his letter, he congratulated you upon
being allied to some one other than the
young person who made his visit to Virginia
last year a very hard test of patience,
to say no more."</p>

<p>She stopped, and tried to turn away her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
head. But Ralph, looking her gently in
the face, read there what gave him courage
to launch the last arrow in his quiver.</p>

<p>"Whatever he said, I saw through it,
Evie dear. And I&mdash;I could not wait to
write an answer. I telegraphed my advice
to come to Naples as fast as steam
can carry him."</p>

<p class="p2">Shortly after her conversation upon the
quay with Ralph (who, returning to
Rome, had been duly translated into anticipated
bliss), Eve and her father took
advantage of a perfect Sunday for the excursion
up Mount Vesuvius.</p>

<p>In a landau with two horses,&mdash;a third
to be annexed on the ascent,&mdash;they traversed
the long street formed by the villages
of San Giovanni, La Barra, Portici,
and Resina, stretching from the parent
city&mdash;a street suggesting in the matter of
population a series of scattered ant-hills.
Such a merry, dirty, shameless horde of
all ages, who, abandoning the dens they
called homes, had issued forth under the
sun blazing even at that early hour of
morning in his vault of blue, to bivouac
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
in the open highway, was never seen!
Marketing, chaffering, vending, gossiping,
cooking, eating, drinking, performing the
rites of religion and of the toilet, the
hum of their voices was like the note of
some giant insect. It was when a stranger's
carriage came in sight that the air
became suddenly vocal with shrill cries
for alms; vehicles and horses were surrounded,
escorted by noisy beggars, whose
half-naked children offered flowers, or
turned somersaults perilously near the
wheels.</p>

<p>Resina passed, they could breathe more
freely. The street turmoil was succeeded
by the peace of a country road mounting
between lava walls, over which glimpses
of sea, of deep-red clover in fields, of vineyard
or lemon grove, were finally succeeded
by glorious, unobstructed views of
the mountains, bay, and city. In the region
of recent overflows, they saw the
most curious spectacle, to the newcomer,
of fertile garden-strips of green, where
clung tiny houses, pink or whitewashed,
daring the mute monster overhead, while
close beside them the mountain-side was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
streaked with ominous stains marking the
spots where other homes had defied him
just one day too long.</p>

<p>Higher still, in the track of the overflow
of 1872, they experienced the striking
effect of entering into a valley of desolation
between walls of living green.
Here, the lava in settling had wreathed itself
into the forms of dragons couchant, of
huge serpents, and other monstrous shapes
that lay entwined as if asleep. Up above,
arose the main cone of the crater, smooth
as a heap of gun-powder, vast, majestic,
cloud-circled; taking upon itself in the
intense light a blooming purple tint; the
smoke issuing from its summit now soon
melting into space, now showing dense
and threatening.</p>

<p>Evelyn, in whom the novelty as well as
beauty of the scene had aroused fresh spirit,
looked more like her old self than her
fond father had seen her for many a long
day. But it is fortunately not given to
parents, however solicitous, to see all the
workings of young minds; and the good
gentleman would have been indeed surprised
had he divined the mainspring of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
her animation. While he was indulging
in a few mild objections to the length and
slowness of the drive, the rapacity of
wayside beggars, the heat of the sun, etc.,
such as naturally occur to the traveller
unsupported by sentimental hopes, to our
young lady the condition of motion was a
necessity, and the act of getting upward
a relief.</p>

<p>For the plain truth was that, since the
last talk with Ralph, Evelyn had given
rein to a thousand emotions repressed,
during the months gone by, with stern
self-chiding.</p>

<p>Until now, recalling the year before
when Vance had left her to an unavailing
sense of regret for her harsh judgment of
him, she had hardly realized what their
intercourse together had meant to her.
But the period of his visit was, in fact,
succeeded by one in which her salt of life
had lost its savor; and Evelyn, to her dismay,
found that her affections had gone
from her keeping to this man's, acknowledged
to have been the suitor of her
friend.</p>

<p>That Katherine had refused Vance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
and straightway married another lover,
made very little difference to one of Eve's
rigid creed in these matters. To her,
love declared was love unchangeable;
with air her heart she pitied Vance for his
disappointment, and blamed herself for
having repeatedly wounded him without
reason. By means of this mode of argument,
she had naturally succeeded in raising
Townsend to the pedestal of a martyred
hero, which, it may be conceived by
those of colder judgment, did not lessen
his importance in the girl's imagination.</p>

<p>As the months had gone on, and she
had had nothing from him save packages
of books and prints sent according to promise,
as to a polite entertainer who is thus
agreeably disposed of by the beneficiary
of hospitality extended, her feelings had
taken on the complexion of hopeless regret
for an irrevocable past. What Eve had
henceforth to do, according to her own
strict ordinance, was to live down the impulse
that made her give her heart unasked.
The stress of these emotions had, in spite
of her brave efforts, so worked upon her
health that the Colonel, as fond of home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
as a limpet of his rock, determined to try
for her the change of air and experience,
resulting as we have seen.</p>

<p>And now, on this dazzling day, a "bridal
of earth and sky" in one of the loveliest
spots upon earth, she kept saying to
herself, "By to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow, at
latest&mdash;he will be with me! And then&mdash;and
then&mdash;and <i>then</i>&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The carriage halted at a little wayside
booth for the sale of wines and fruit. A
dark-skinned woman, bearing a tray of
glasses, with flasks of the delusive <i>Lachrymae
Christi</i> (made from the grapes ripened
upon these slopes) came forward to greet
them. On Evelyn's side, a hawker, with
shells and strings of coral, and coins alleged
to have been found imbedded in the
lava near at hand, importuned her. But,
rejecting the others, she beckoned to a
pretty, bare-legged boy carrying oranges
garnished in their own glossy, dark-green
leaves; and so busy was she in selecting
the best of his refreshing fruit, she hardly
observed that another claimant for her
attention had appeared close beside the
wheel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>"Please go away, my good man," she
said at last, laughingly, without giving him
a glance. "Indeed, I want nothing you
can supply."</p>

<p>"That is a harsh assertion," Vance said,
in a low tone meant for her ear, and then
proceeded to greet both his cousins outspokenly.</p>

<p>He had reached Naples early that morning;
had ascertained at their hotel that they
were engaged to start for Vesuvius at a
given hour; fearing collision with a party
of strangers, had set out alone to walk up
the mountain and take his chance of intercepting
them; and had waited here for
the purpose.</p>

<p>"After you had been journeying all
night?" said the Colonel, with unfeigned
surprise. "Why, my dear fellow, in your
place I should have&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then he intercepted, passing between
Evelyn and Vance, a look that
startled him. That his sentence remained
unfinished nobody observed. The Colonel
drew back into his corner, as if he had
been shot.</p>

<p>If she had divined her father's feeling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Eve could not have pitied any one who
was gaining Vance. And Vance, at that
moment, believed all the world to be as
happy as himself!</p>

<p class="p2">To a love-affair so obvious, the ending
naturally to be expected is of the old-fashioned
and inevitable sort. In the
beautiful Indian summer of the following
autumn in Virginia, these two people were
duly married at the Hall. From far and
wide came relatives to wish them joy; it
was like the gathering of a Scotch clan at
the summons of the pipes. Prominent
among the revellers at the dance following
the nuptial ceremony was Cousin Josey,
who, in a pair of antiquated leather pumps
with buckles, led down the middle of a
reel with his cherished "Lady-love." To
please the old boy, Evelyn had worn the
little string of pearls bought by him, years
before, for a bride who was never to be.
And so everybody was content, and one
of the cousins said it was "exactly like a
weddin' befo' the wah."

<h2 class="p6">Out of Season</h2>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>"No; no house-parties till the middle
of July. Dear knows, what
with a string of big dinners, my two little
dances, and those tiresome Thursdays in
January and February when everybody
came, I have done all that could be expected
by society from paupers like ourselves,"
said Mrs. Henry Gervase, settling
herself in a wicker chair, on the veranda
of her country home, and looking approvingly
at her water-view.</p>

<p>"Paupers!" said a lady from a neighboring
cottage, who had dropped in to call.
Mrs. Gervase's friends rarely liked to commit
themselves to positive comment upon
her statements until certain which way the
cat was meant to jump. Mrs. Luther
Prettyman, the wife of the dry-goods magnate,
whose good fortune it was to own
the land adjoining the Gervase property at
Sheepshead Point,&mdash;a recently famous resort
for summer visitors on our far eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
coast,&mdash;now contented herself with a
little deprecatory giggle that might mean
anything, and waited for Mrs. Gervase to
go on.</p>

<p>"Oh, well! everything is comparative;
and on the scale by which people measure
things in New York, to-day, we are simply
grovelling in poverty. John,"&mdash;to
her gardener,&mdash;"you have got that row
of myosotis entirely out of line; and, remember,
nothing but salvia behind the
heliotropes. I like a blaze of scarlet and
purple against a blue sea-line like this.
Heavens! what a perfect afternoon! The
atmosphere has been clarified, and those
birches in the ravine 'twinkle with a million
lights.' My dear woman, I make no
apologies. Any one who wants me at this
season of the year must take me as I am.
After eight months of bricks and mortar,
dirty streets, and stupid drives in the Park,
I am fairly maudlin over Nature when I
get her back in June.</p>

<p>"I went to a concert where Paderewski
played a night or two before he left
America; and I give you my word that
while the music was going on I put up my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
fan and plainly heard the babble of this
little brook of mine, and the lap of the
waves over the rocks at high tide, with,
now and then, the notes of the song-sparrow
that comes back every year and
perches on my Norway pine. Somebody
said of me afterwards, at supper, that I
had been having a little nap. They may
say anything of me, I believe, and some
idiot will be found to credit it. But please
don't accept the newspaper report that I
am to have Mr. and Mrs. This, or Mr.
That and Mrs. T'other, stopping with me
at Stoneacres during June. I am much
too busy with my granger-work, and my
husband too industrious doing nothing, to
play host and hostess now."</p>

<p>"I did not know; I only thought&mdash;"
ventured Mrs. Prettyman. "You see,
everything is so dull here, socially, till
August. And when one has a guest coming
who is accustomed to a great deal of
fashionable gaiety,&mdash;a young lady, a distinguished
belle,&mdash;one naturally grasps at
the idea of such pleasant house-parties as
yours are known to be, dear Mrs. Gervase."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall be dull as ditch-water," answered
relentless Mrs. Gervase, turning
around to survey the struggle of a fat-breasted
robin to extract from the turf a
worm that continued to emerge in apparently
unending length. "And if you <i>will</i>
have a girl out of season, why, put her on
bread and milk and beauty-sleep, give her
plenty of trashy novels and a horse to ride,
and she'll do well enough."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;perhaps I am wrong&mdash;surely
Mr. Gervase told Mr. Prettyman, when
they were smoking on our veranda last
Sunday, that you are expecting your
nephew, Mr. Alan Grove."</p>

<p>"That's just like Mr. Gervase,&mdash;a perfect
sieve for secrets," quoth Mrs. Gervase,
contemptuously; "when I particularly
requested him to mention Alan's visit to
nobody. The poor boy is completely used
up with work, and has engaged to get a
paper ready to read before some scientific
congress next month, and finds himself
unable to write a line of it in town. Here,
I have promised him, he may have absolute
quiet&mdash;not be called on to play civility
or squire-of-dames for any one; and, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
may as well warn you <i>now</i>, he's not to be
expected to do a <i>hand's turn</i> of entertainment
for your girl. Besides, I happen to
know that he can't abide 'society' young
women. He is plunged up to the neck in
electricity, is poor, ambitious, clever, on
the way to sure success; and I'm going
to back him all I can, not put stumbling-blocks
in his path."</p>

<p>"How plunged up to his neck in electricity?"
asked puzzled Mrs. Prettyman.</p>

<p>"Electric law, my good soul; did you
think it a new kind of capital punishment?
The lucrative law of the future, I've heard
wise men say. Simpkins!" hailing, with
irresistible command, a butcher's cart that
seemed possessed of a strong desire to
drive away in a hurry from a side entrance
to the house. "<i>Simpkins!</i> Oh! there you
are; I meant to leave orders with the cook
not to let you get away again to-day without
a word from me. I noticed, on the
book, that you had the effrontery to charge
sixty cents a pound for spring chickens
here in June. Now, don't tell me! The
way all you natives do; you have a short
season, and must make the most of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
This is not your season, or my season,
either. Wait till August before you put
on the screws. And your sweetbreads,
eighty cents a pair, when <i>you know</i> that
when Mr. Gervase and I first came here
to live, you were <i>throwing sweetbreads away</i>,
till we taught you the use of them! Now,
mind, I shall get tired of sending friends
to you to be fleeced in August, if this is
what you do to me in June."</p>

<p>"I must be running off," said Mrs.
Prettyman, arising from her spot of shade
and luxurious comfort in the deep veranda
filled, though not encumbered, with
picturesque belongings, with stands and
pots of blooming plants in every nook.
"I'll declare, nobody's flowers do as well
as yours. And the wages we pay our head
gardener! It makes me really envious."</p>

<p>This, be it known, was a clever stroke
on the part of neighbor Prettyman. Secretly
resentful of the tepid interest in the
personality of her expected guest,&mdash;who,
in the eyes of the house of Prettyman, was
an event,&mdash;she yet did not dare attempt
to bring the greater lady to yield sympathy
upon the spot. Mrs. Gervase's weakest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
side was for her flowers. She possessed
the magic touch that alone nurtures them
to perfection, and with it the proud love
of a parent for children that grow inclined
according to her will.</p>

<p>"Hum! We do pretty well, considering
this house is built on the ragged edge of
nothing over the sea, and is swept by all
the winds of heaven, in turn, and sometimes
all together. And, in a climate
where one goes to bed in the Tropics and
wakes up at the North Pole, what would
you have? John, there, though I'll not
set him up by telling him so, has learned
all I know about flowers, and picks up
new ideas every day. By August, now,
these beds and stands will be worth looking
at. What did you say is the name of
the young person who's coming to stop
with you? If you've nothing better, suppose
you and she and Mr. Prettyman come
over to dinner Saturday. Alan has promised
me not to work at night, and by that
time my plants will all be in the ground
and my mind at rest."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," said the lesser
luminary. "It is always a treat to dine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
with you <i>en famille</i>; and it is&mdash;didn't I
mention her?&mdash;Gladys Eliot who is coming
to us to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Gladys Eliot! Why, she's gone with
her people to London for two months. I
saw her name in the <i>Teutonic's</i> list last
Thursday. Those Eliots would never in
the world let slip another chance for her
to make the great match they've set out
to get."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Mrs. Prettyman,
with some show of spirit, "Mrs. Eliot,
who is my old school-friend, wrote me, the
day before they sailed, that Gladys had
taken it into her head to stay behind, and
begged me to keep her till her aunt can
come up from Baltimore in July and take
the girl in charge."</p>

<p>"Three weeks of Gladys Eliot!" remarked
Mrs. Gervase. "My poor woman,
I pity you. By the end of the month
there will be no health in you. A professional
beauty, who has run the gauntlet
of four or five years of incessant praises,
has been advertised like 'Pear's Soap,' in
England and America, and has failed to
make her <i>coup</i>! I remember what Alan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Grove said about her no longer ago than
Christmas of last year: 'I haven't the
advantage of Miss Eliot's acquaintance,
but her and her kind I hold in abhorrence,&mdash;denationalized
Americans; hangers-on
of older civilizations that make a puppet-show
of them; spoiled for home, with
no rightful place abroad; restless, craving
what no healthy-minded husband of their
own kind can give them.' Bless me&mdash;and
<i>those two</i> are going to <i>meet here</i>!"</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Alan Grove need not
concern himself," said Mrs. Prettyman,
driven to bay. "Mrs. Eliot mentioned in
her letter that Gladys&mdash;it is no secret,
evidently&mdash;is nearly, if not quite, engaged
to marry some one the family feels
is <i>in all respects</i> all they could have hoped
for her."</p>

<p>"Then it must be either that Colonel
Larkyns, the very rude man with large
feet, who walked all over my velvet gown
at the Egertons', last winter,&mdash;came over
with Lord Glenmore, whom the Eliots
tried for and couldn't get,&mdash;or else McLaughlin,
the Irishman who made such a
lot of money in Montana. The two men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
were running evenly, 'twas said. Let me
think&mdash;didn't I see her at Claremont on
McLaughlin's coach, last month? Pray,
my dear, are we to congratulate you on
having Mr. McLaughlin, also, as a member
of your household, before long?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, dear!" continued the plain-spoken
lady to herself, when poor Mrs.
Prettyman, fairly routed, had retired without
honors from the field. "Why is
nature so heavenly kind to us in American
places of resort, and 'only man is vile'?
Why does this struggle for place, this
pride of vogue, these types of our worst
social element&mdash;I hate that word 'social,'
it sounds vulgar; but what else expresses
this for me?&mdash;follow one into this earthly
Paradise? Here I have got myself into
a pretty kettle of fish with Alan Grove.
He will be bored to death and his visit
broken up, for we can't rid ourselves
of people who sit in our pocket, like
the Prettymans in summer; and he will
be running upon this Eliot creature perpetually.
If Henry would help me, we
might&mdash;but he is so abominably friendly
and cordial with country neighbors, there's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
no hope from him. Besides, if a girl is
pretty, it makes no earthly difference to
my good man whether she is a fiend of
calculation and cold-heartedness. I declare,
I've no patience with Henry, anyhow."</p>

<p>So saying, Mrs. Gervase went out to
drive with the offender in question, behind
a pair of sleek cobs, in a little buckboard
of tawny wood with russet leather cushions
and harness,&mdash;his latest present,&mdash;and
soon, in cheerful companionship, forgot
all sorrows amid such views of land
and water as Sheepshead Point people
think only Sheepshead Point can offer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>To reach Sheepshead Point, a boat
steams daily, and several times a day,
from a station on the line of a great railway
skirting the eastern Atlantic coast. Issuing
from a drawing-room car there, a young
woman, dressed in a tight-fitting skirt and
jacket of sailor blue, with a loose shirt of
red silk belted around a taper waist, her
small head with its sailor-hat half shrouded
from view in a blue tissue veil, walked
lightly ahead of Mr. Alan Grove and,
attended by an elderly maid, went far forward
to stand in the bows of the boat.</p>

<p>Grove, struck by the grace and distinction
of her carriage, looked again, and
then was conscious of an actual fierce
jump of the heart.</p>

<p>"Can there be two of them?" he
asked of his inner man. "Doctors tell
you if you keep your body in good order,
and your mind healthily at work, you will
never see a ghost&mdash;and yet&mdash;that's the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
double of the woman who sailed away
from me last Thursday; who's haunted
me during the six madly misspent weeks
since I had the misfortune to be told off
to take her in to dinner. Oh! no, it isn't.
Yes, it is&mdash;by Jove, it <i>is</i> Gladys Eliot."</p>

<p>He was never so astonished. Believing
her to be at that moment on the ocean,
nearing British shores, Grove was fairly
staggered when Miss Eliot, turning, espied
him and, by a graciously easy nod, summoned
him to her side. Considering the
manner of their parting a few weeks back,
he wondered at himself for the immediate
abjectness of his obedience.</p>

<p>It was a favorite phrase of Gladys
Eliot's admirers to describe her as having
a "Duchess of Leinster head and throat."
Nature had certainly bestowed upon this
daughter of nobody in particular in the
Western Hemisphere a pose of a proud
little head upon broad, sloping shoulders,
as fine as that much-photographed great
lady's. She had, in addition, a pair of
innocent, Irish-blue eyes and a guileless
smile; a voice, in speaking, that was sweet
and low; and the best or worst manners in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
the world, so critics said, according to the
desirableness of her interlocutor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Grove! How perfectly extraordinary
that you should be here," she
exclaimed, giving him the tips of her
well-gloved fingers, while the maid and
dressing-bag withdrew discreetly into the
background.</p>

<p>"Did you expect me to remain forever
on the steps of the Claremont tea-house,
like a monument of a city father, to adorn
the suburbs of New York?"</p>

<p>"You are so quick-tempered, so unreasonable!
How should I know you were
going to take such dire offence? But
please&mdash;I can't quarrel away off here,
or even justify myself. If you are going
to remain furious with me, at least gratify
my curiosity first, and tell me how you
came on this boat, and where you are
going. Then, if you are so inclined, you
may retire into your shell and sulk."</p>

<p>A soft light was shining in her eye.
Her voice was pleading; her face, most
beautiful. Grove, promising himself, in
street vernacular, to "go off and kick himself"
directly afterwards, took his place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
at her elbow and gazed down hungrily
upon her artless, changeful countenance.</p>

<p>"Rather tell me why you are not about
to plant your triumphant banner on British
shores once more. I read your name
in the list of those sailing. The newspapers
have given all of your summer plans
in detail, all the country-houses that are to
receive you, all the aristocrats that are to
send invitations to dinner, to meet your
ship at Queenstown."</p>

<p>She colored slightly. "As usual, you
are making fun of me. What would be
the use, since you won't believe me, of
telling you my actual reason for backing
out of this English visit, and letting my
mother and sister go without me? No, I
shan't flatter you by showing my real self."</p>

<p>"I have seen enough of your real self,
thank you. I believe I prefer the unreal,
the imaginary woman I suffered myself to
fancy you to be for a brief space after our
acquaintance began."</p>

<p>"Now you are rude," she began, her
voice faltering ever so little, but enough
to shake his equilibrium. He made a
movement towards her; and she looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
him in the face, trying to keep down the
tingle of satisfaction in her veins. For
Gladys's experience of men had taught
her to recognize in a certain phase of incivility
the existence of passion unsubdued.
It is only indifference in his sex that can
maintain an armor of polite self-control
towards hers.</p>

<p>Grove caught the transient gleam in her
eye, and read it aright. Immediately he
was on the defensive, and his manner
froze.</p>

<p>"I believe you know my aunt, Mrs.
Gervase, in town," he said. "I think I
saw you at one of her dances, in January."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gervase is the dearest thing,"
interrupted Miss Eliot, conscious of blankness
in her tone.</p>

<p>"She may be, but it would be a brave
person who would tell her so. She is a
delightful, but autocratic, personage; and
one of the treats of the year for me is to
get away to her and my uncle for a holiday,
when they have no one else. This
is one of those rare occasions. The cottage
people who have come down to
Sheepshead have a tacit agreement to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
to themselves, just now. They are supposed
to be getting their houses to rights,
and making gardens, and what not. Mrs.
Gervase says they are really wearing out
the past season's gloves, and putting tonics
on their hair, and trying new cures and
doses, for which there was no time before
leaving town. The days will pass in doing
as we please, and in the evening we
shall dine well (for the Gervases have a
corker of a cook), after which my aunt
and uncle and I will take each a book and
a lamp into some nook of the library, and
read till bedtime. You can't imagine a
life more to my taste."</p>

<p>"Prohibitory to outsiders, at least," said
Gladys. "This is, as I suppose you mean
it to be, awfully alarming to me; for I
haven't told you that I am for three weeks
to be Mrs. Gervase's nearest neighbor. I
am going to visit an old friend of my mother's,&mdash;Mrs.
Luther Prettyman."</p>

<p>Grove experienced a sensation of dismay.
The Prettymans! Château Calicot,
as he had dubbed their new florid
"villa," built on the shore in objectionable
proximity to his uncle's house, some three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
years back! He remembered the vines
planted, the shrubs set out, the rattan
screens hung, the final adjustment of chairs
by Mrs. Gervase, in the attempt to shut
out every glimpse of the Prettyman belongings
from their place of daily rendezvous
on the veranda at Stoneacres; his uncle's
sly amusement when the cupola of the
Prettyman stables, and the roof of a detestable
little sugar-temple tea-house were
projected on their line of vision, spite of
all. Mrs. Gervase could not forgive herself
for not having secured that point of
land when land was so ridiculously cheap.
On an average of once a day, she reminded
her husband that she had begged him to
do so, and he had put it off until too late.</p>

<p>Mrs. Prettyman, unvisited by Mrs. Gervase
for many months after the red-brown
gables of her costly dwelling rose into
prominence at Sheepshead Point, had gradually
found her way into quasi-intimacy at
Stoneacres. Mrs. Gervase, protesting that
her neighbor was commonplace, vacuous,
a being from whom one could derive nothing
more profitable than the address of a
place in town to have one's lace lampshades
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
made a dollar cheaper than elsewhere,
allowed herself, in time, to take a
mild but perceptible interest in Prettyman
affairs. Through force of habit, she had
grown accustomed to survey the Prettyman
lodge-gates, in driving, without remarking
upon "the absurdity of gilded
finials to iron railings, at a rough, seaside
place like this." Nay, the noses of the
Gervase cobs were now not infrequently
turned in through these gilded railings.
Mr. and Mrs. Gervase dined periodically
with the Prettymans. The Prettymans
repaired more frequently to Stoneacres.
Mrs. Prettyman made capital, in town, of
her friendship with "dear Mrs. Gervase."
This, Grove, like the rest of the world,
had come gradually to know and accept.
But it grated on him to hear that the
woman who, so far, had furnished his life
its chief feminine influence should be associated
in this way with the mistress of
Château Calicot. It belittled his one passion&mdash;now
put away as dead, but still his
own. This, indeed, set the crowning
touch upon his misfortune of meeting her
again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>"My dear boy, you might have
knocked me down with a feather,"
said Mrs. Gervase, upon capturing her
nephew at the wharf and driving away
with him. "Tell me at once what you
mean by knowing Gladys Eliot, and arriving
with her in that intimate sort of way,
just as I had, with infinite trouble, succeeded
in bluffing the Prettymans with a
mere dinner on Saturday! Now you will
be <i>having</i> to call. <i>You</i>, of all people, hitting
it off with Gladys Eliot!"</p>

<p>"Give yourself no concern," put in
Mr. Gervase, who was driving, looking
back over his shoulder with a beaming
smile; "I offer to throw myself into the
breach. A woman as beautiful, as tall, as
placid, as Miss Eliot commands the best
homage of my heart. I forewarn you
that I am going desperately into this affair.
Such luck never came my way before."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop at the confectioner's for the
macaroons, Henry," said his wife, ignoring
transports. "Alan, you are looking
wretched. When I think of those ruddy,
brown cheeks, and the look of vigor you
brought out of your college athletics a few
years back, I'm inclined to renounce mind
and go in for muscle exclusively. Oh,
that wretched grind of life in New York
that crushes the youth and spirit out of
you poor boys that have to toil for a living!
Surely, it isn't <i>only</i> law that's
worked such havoc in those pale, thin
cheeks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Agatha, your sympathy
would put a well man in his bed," said
Mr. Gervase, whose keen eyes took in
more of the actual situation than did his
wife's.</p>

<p>"Oh well!&mdash;stop here, please; no,
I won't get down, Jonas sees me; he
will be out directly, with the parcel&mdash;you
must see, Henry, that Alan has changed,
even since&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alan, let me tell you of a bill our
friend Jonas, here, who is a bit of a horse-jockey,
as well as local confectioner and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
pastry-cook, sent in recently to your aunt.
He had been selling her a mate to her
chestnut, and the account ran this way:</p>

<p class="p2 center">"'<span class="smcap">Mrs. H. GERVASE to I. JONAS, Dr.</span></p>

</table>

<p>Grove was glad to cover his various discomforts
with a laugh. But he did not
find it easy to elude the vigilance of Mrs.
Gervase, who bided her time until an opportunity
presented itself for an uninterrupted
talk with him.</p>

<p>"Stretch yourself out on that bamboo
couch, and let me put the pillows in," she
said, when they two adjourned to the veranda,
in the twilight after dinner. "It
is such fun to have a boy to cosset once
more, with my own lads at college, and
three weeks to wait before I can get Tom
and Louis back from New London after
the boat-race."</p>

<p>"You have such an inspired faculty
for making men comfortable," Grove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
remarked, from the depths of his <i>bien-être</i>.</p>

<p>"Custom, I suppose. An only daughter,
with a father and three brothers to
wait upon till I married, and a husband
and two sons to impose on me since. I
should not know how to handle girls. I
like them, of course,&mdash;find them all very
well in their way,&mdash;but they bother me.
Perhaps it is that there are no old-fashioned
girls any more&mdash;no young ones,
certainly. They come into the world like
Minerva from Jove's brain. They are so
learned, or clever, or worldly-wise, read
everything, see everything, hear everything
discussed, have no illusions&mdash;but,
there, I can't explain my preference.
Men are captious, obstinate, whimsical, by
turns; disappoint one continually in little
things&mdash;but in the main they are so
broad and big; scatter nonsense into thin
air; are so loyal and unswerving to their
beliefs; know where they stand, and, having
made up their minds to action, do not
change."</p>

<p>"In short," remarked Grove, "you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
like the little servant-maid in Cranford,
when they told her to hand the potatoes
to the ladies first. 'I'll do as you bid me,
ma'am, but I like the lads best.' My
dearest auntie, there must be guardian angels
specially appointed to look after our
sex, and you are one of them. This is
the age and America is the field for the
unchecked efflorescence of young womankind.
But when the conversation takes
on this complexion, I feel it to be unfair
not to allow the defendant the assistance
of counsel; though, even if Uncle Henry
were here, I am sure we should both be
demolished speedily."</p>

<p>"Never mind Henry," said that gentleman's
representative. "He has got a new
letter from a man in London whom he
keeps for the purpose of making him miserable
with catalogues of sales of books
and papers he can't afford to buy. But
he potters over them, and marks the lists,
and writes back to the man in London,
and, as you know, we do manage to become
possessed of much more dear antiquity
than the house will hold or our income
warrant. This time, he is buried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
alive for an hour to come, for it is about
a sale of Sir Philip Francis's letters and
manuscripts at Sotheby's very soon."</p>

<p>"I don't believe the real 'Junius' announcing
himself would get me out of
this bamboo chair and away from this
deepening of eventide upon the sea and
islands, the afterglow of sunset melting
into moonlight, the soft caressing of the
salt air blending with those hidden heliotropes
of yours! Now, dear lady, let's go
back to the concrete. I knew, the moment
your eagle eye fell on me this afternoon,
you would find out all that in me is.
For so many years I've been telling you
my scrapes, I may as well out with the
latest and biggest of them. Two months
ago, I took Gladys Eliot in to dinner at the
Sargents'. I kept it from you in town,
for which you'll say I am properly punished.
I fell in love with her, like a
schoolboy with green apples, heeding not
the danger of unwholesomeness. After
that, I met her when and wherever I could
push my way to her. I thought of her,
sleeping and waking; received from her
looks and tones and words that would, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
the lady novelists are so fond of saying,
'tempt an anchorite;' <i>believed</i> in her!"</p>

<p>"My poor child, how wretched!" said
Mrs. Gervase, promptly.</p>

<p>"So it proved. Last but not least of
the comedy,&mdash;I skip the details,&mdash;I was
deluded into buttoning myself up in a
fluffy, long-tailed, iron-gray coat that I got
in London last spring and had not had
time to wear, put on a bunch of white
carnations, and drove out to one of those
inane Claremont teas in my friend Pierre
Sargent's trap, because, forsooth, <i>she</i> asked
me. For an hour I suffered martyrdom
in that little greenhouse sort of a veranda,
with people herded together gossiping, and
not setting their feet upon the lawn over
the river that they came out to see.
Women talked drivel to me, waiters
slopped tea over me, and we walked on
slices of buttered bread. Then <i>she</i> came&mdash;on
the box-seat of that brute McLaughlin's
drag, having eyes for him only,
so that every one talked of it!"</p>

<p>"I remember&mdash;and I could not imagine
what brought you there. Yes, I sat
down on a little cake and completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
ruined my new porcelain-blue <i>crépon</i>&mdash;those
waiters were very careless. Jolly
faded it trying to take out the spot, and
Mathilde had the greatest trouble to match
the stuff. Alan, that man McLaughlin
ought to be drummed out of polite society.
The girl who would receive his attentions,
let herself be talked of as likely
to be his wife, cannot at heart be nice.
When your dear mother and I were girls,
we would not have <i>looked</i> at a big, vulgar
creature like that, simply because he drove
four-in-hand and was known to be rich.
He would never have been asked to your
grandfather's table. The materialism of
this age takes, to me, no form more objectionable
than the frank acceptance of such
as he by women, old and young."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Grove, grimly. "And
when I met her at his side, she turned
away from him one moment with a banal
jest for me, and then quickly recaptured
him, as if fearful he would escape. That,
even my infatuation would not suffer. I
turned on my heel, and, until I met her
by chance on the boat to-day, have never
seen her since."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>"What can have been her reason for
not going abroad?" said Mrs. Gervase,
eagerly&mdash;a trifle suspiciously.</p>

<p>Grove was silent. In his ear sounded
a dulcet voice, murmuring as the boat
neared shore: "Perhaps, when you have
consented to feel better friends with me,
you will come and let me tell you <i>why I
stayed</i>."</p>

<p>"You know, of course, that everybody
says she is engaged? Her mother has
hinted it to Mrs. Prettyman. If it be to
this McLaughlin, then God knows you are
well rid of her. If that be a blind, Alan
dear,&mdash;you know it was always my way
with you boys to scold about little things
and let great ones pass,&mdash;I shan't add a
word to your self-reproach; but I'll warn
you&mdash;oh! I won't have the sin on my
soul of letting you go unwarned. That
woman, no matter whether she thinks she
loves you or not, would make your misery.
The parents of to-day don't trouble
themselves to train up wives for the rank
and file of our honest gentlemen. They
create fine ladies, and look about for some
one to take the expense of them off their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
hands. It is common talk that the Eliots
have been strained to their utmost means
to carry their girls from place to place,
with the expectation of making rich marriages.
The beauty and success of this
one has apparently blinded those poor people
to the consequences of their folly.
The girl has been brought up to fancy herself
of superior clay,&mdash;her habits are luxurious,
her wants extravagant.</p>

<p>"More than all, for five years she has
been fed on the flatteries of society. Personal
praise is indispensable to her. She
has lived and consorted with the most lavish
entertainers of the most reckless society
in our republic. Even supposing that you
won her beauty and graces for your own,
what on earth could you expect to offer
her in exchange for what she would give
up? My poor, dear lad, I'm talking platitudes,
you think; but you and Tom and
Louis shall not be allowed to wreck your
futures upon such as Gladys Eliot, while I
have breath to speak. I'm afraid I think
all marriages a mistake for young men. I
know they are, as we measure and value
things, in what we call 'fashionable life.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Go out of it, by all means, if you can.
To take <i>her</i> out of it you would find to be
quite another matter. And now, after this
long homily, I've one question to put.
Answer it, if you like&mdash;if you think I've
the right to ask it. After seeing her again
to-day, do you feel there is danger in her
proximity?"</p>

<p>"You have certainly torn sentiment to
shreds," said Alan, getting up from amid
his cushions and beginning to stride up and
down the long veranda. Mrs. Gervase
watched him without further speech. That
he did not again allude to the subject sent
her to bed with keen anxiety and a renewed
regret that Mr. Gervase had not
taken her advice about buying that point
of land before it fell into the hands of the
Prettymans.</p>

<p>For the two or three days following his
arrival at Stoneacres, Grove made no attempt
to see his neighbor's guest. Once,
indeed, they encountered her on horseback,
while driving together in a family party in
the buckboard, behind the cobs. Mr. Gervase,
who, in his later enthusiasm about
the Junius correspondence, had forgotten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
his charmer, asked who was that stunning,
pretty girl, and, on being rallied by his wife,
declared his poor sight was at fault, and
that he meant to call on the Prettymans
that very day; but Saturday brought with
it the appointed dinner, without other overture
from Stoneacres than cards left by
Mrs. Gervase when the ladies were from
home.</p>

<p>Grove was hardly surprised when, on
descending to the drawing-room in evening
clothes, he found only that very colorless
pair of Prettymans. Miss Eliot, it was
alleged, was suffering from too long a ride
in the hot sun of the afternoon to make
the effort to come out. He saw in the
countenance of his aunt a look of relief,
which she at once proceeded to mask by
unusual suavity to mankind in general, her
flattered guests in particular.</p>

<p>"The worst is over; I am safe," Grove
decided. "But I like her all the better
for that womanly holding back. Now, to
live down my folly as best I can."</p>

<p>He threw himself into hard work, and
the days passed healthily. Mrs. Gervase
had begun to relax her vigilance, to breathe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
almost free of care, when, upon one of his
morning rides, ahead of him in a forest
glade, he espied Gladys Eliot, in the saddle,
attended by one of the Prettyman boys,
a youngster of thirteen, mounted on a polo
pony in process of "showing off" his and
his master's accomplishments.</p>

<p>At the sound behind them, both Gladys
and the boy turned to look; and Grove
saw that he could not retreat without a
decided lack of dignity. He therefore rode
by them, receiving from Miss Eliot a faint
and chilly nod; from the boy,&mdash;an acquaintance
of last year,&mdash;a more cordial
salutation.</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Grove, <i>can't</i> Punch take
that fallen tree?" cried out the lad, in
shrill treble. "<i>She</i> says it's dangerous,
because the bank is caved. Hold on one
minute, and I'll show you he can clear it,
bank and all."</p>

<p>Punch, proving nothing loth, jumped
the obstacles in question gallantly, but on
the far side slipped on something, and
spilled his rider among a bed of tall bracken,
in which the boy lay, lost to sight. Both
Grove and Gladys were in a minute at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
side, shocked at finding him white and
senseless.</p>

<p>"It was not the fall," she said, rapidly.
"He has heart-trouble, and his mother is
always anxious about a sudden shock for
him. He will outgrow it probably, the
doctors say. Here, you hold him in your
arms, while I get water from that brook.
I know what to do, and he will soon come
to himself."</p>

<p>Grove found himself silently obeying
her behests. He was struck by her prompt
presence of mind, her deftness, and good
sense. "What an admirable trained nurse
is lost to the world in her!" he thought,
and, when all was done, and the boy gave
token of returning life, sat still, content to
crush down moss and ferns, awkwardly
holding his burden, while Gladys knelt so
close that her breath in speaking fanned
his cheek.</p>

<p>"It wasn't Punch's fault. I've got a
big bee buzzing in my head," were the
welcome words they at last heard from
the sufferer.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, Jim dear, but don't
talk now till the big bee flies away," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
the boy, closing his eyes, appeared to
sleep.</p>

<p>"Lay his head on my lap, and then, if
you don't mind riding back and ordering
some sort of a trap, without letting his
mother know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't leave you here. It is too far
from home, and the country hereabouts is
quite bare of dwellings. Nor would I
like you to ride so far alone. There;
let him sleep, and we will watch him till
he wakes. No doctor could have treated
him more cleverly than you."</p>

<p>"It's the result of a 'First Aid to the
Injured' class I went to once, perhaps.
But I always had a knack with ill people,"
she said, dropping the deep fringes of her
eyes upon damask cheeks.</p>

<p class="p2">That evening, Grove could do no less
than call to inquire after Master Jim,
who, not much the worse for his attack,
kept his adoring mother in durance at his
bedside, while Grove sat watching the opal
flushes die out of a western sky, in company
with Gladys. Quite another Gladys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
was this, in all save beauty and her dulcet
voice, from his enslaver of town life.</p>

<p>And now, to Mrs. Gervase's ill-concealed
dismay, visits, meetings, rides, boating,
began and continued daily. Grove
was teaching Miss Eliot chess, he said,
and the other things were what they call
upon the stage "incidental divertisements."</p>

<p>A fortnight of glorious weather had
passed thus, when, on the eve of Grove's
return to town and work, he asked Gladys
to go out in a boat with him to watch the
sunset on the water.</p>

<p>"Now you have told me there is no
reason I may not speak, I can wait no
longer for an answer," he said, as, resting
on his oars, he scanned her face eagerly.
"When a man tears his heart out and
throws it at a woman's feet, surely he
offers something. But that, you know, is
my all. If you can consent to share the
kind of life mine has got to be for the
next five or six years, I think I see daylight
beyond. By that time, your first youth
will be gone, you will be forgotten by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
people who court you now, you will be a
nobody in their esteem. To me, you will
always be the one woman of the world.
You will have the full love of my heart;
and you shall see what that means, when
a true man pours it upon you unrestrained.
I don't pretend to be worth it, Heaven
knows. But I do say you have never before
been loved by a man like me, and you
know it and feel it thoroughly. It's for
you to take or leave me, accepting consequences."</p>

<p>"What a stand-and-deliver kind of love-making,"
Gladys tried to say; but she
was deeply stirred. Remaining silent, her
eyes filled with tears; her head drooped
towards her breast.</p>

<p>"Gladys!" cried he, exultingly.</p>

<p>"Don't you see, now, the real reason
why I could not go abroad?" she said,
smiling on him brightly, and lifting, at the
same moment, her ungloved left hand to
put back a loose lock of hair that the wind
had blown across her cheek. Grove, gazing
at her with his whole soul in his eyes,
became aware of a ring upon the fourth
finger,&mdash;a ring of such conspicuous brilliancy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and choice gems as to convey
but one meaning,&mdash;and his expression
changed.</p>

<p>"Oh! I hate it! I shall give it back!"
she exclaimed, a burning blush settling
upon her face. "I did not mean&mdash;it was
an accident. I hate it, I tell you! Why
do you look at me like that?"</p>

<p>She tore the ring from her hand, and
impetuously put it out of sight. Presently,
as Grove, in mechanical fashion, resumed
his rowing without a word, she cried out,
passionately:</p>

<p>"Why do you not ask me to explain all
the&mdash;circumstances of my life since I
saw you last? Why can't you understand
that a girl situated as I am has temptations
that at times seem to her irresistible?
Need I mortify myself by telling you that
I am <i>driven</i>&mdash;driven till I feel as if I
would do anything to get rest from eternal
lectures about what a rich marriage has
got to do for me&mdash;and for others? Yes,
you are right in saying that a man like
you never before asked me to marry him.
Because I feel that&mdash;because&mdash;because&mdash;Oh!
you are cruel not to speak&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
help me! How can I put into
words that I am willing to give up all&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was impossible, facing the rigid coldness
of his face, to go on. She sat in
wretched silence till they reached shore,
and he gave her his chilly hand to help
her upon the float. Then the touch of
her fingers sent a tremor of relenting into
his veins.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could! If I could! But he
too&mdash;that other one&mdash;believed. Tell
me; he does not still believe in you?"</p>

<p>"I hate him," she said, doggedly. She
shivered a little, as the quickened breeze
of evening struck her thinly-clad form.</p>

<p>Grove, clasping her hand, gazed into
her eyes with a desperate resolve to read
her heart.</p>

<p>"Let me go&mdash;it is no use," she said,
turning away from him.</p>

<p>And, with a sigh deep as Fate, he loosened
his hold of her&mdash;forever.

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>From Maxwell Pollock, Esq., No. &mdash;
Fifth Avenue, New York, to Stephen
Cranbrooke, Esq., &mdash;&mdash; Club,
New York.</p>
<p class="left65">
"May 30, 189-.</p>

<p>"My dear Cranbrooke:</p>

<p>"You will wonder why I follow up our
conversation of last evening with a letter;
why, instead of speaking, I should write
what is left to be said between us two.</p>

<p>"But after a sleepless night, of which
my little wife suspects nothing, I am impelled
to confide in you&mdash;my oldest
friend, <i>her</i> friend, although you and she
have not yet grown to the comprehension
of each other I hoped for when she married
me three years ago&mdash;a secret that has
begun to weigh heavy upon my soul.</p>

<p>"I do not need to remind you that,
since our college days, you have known me
subject to fits of moodiness and depression
upon which you have often rallied me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
How many times you have said that a fellow
to whom Fate had given health,
strength, opportunity, and fortune&mdash;and
recently the treasure of a lovely and loving
wife&mdash;has no business to admit the
word 'depression' into his vocabulary!</p>

<p>"This is true. I acknowledge it, as I
have a thousand times before. I am a
fool, a coward, to shrink from what is before
me. But I was still more of a fool
and a coward when I married her. For
her sake, the prospect of my death before
this summer wanes impels me to own to
you my certainty that my end is close at
hand.</p>

<p>"In every generation of our family
since the old fellow who came over from
England and founded us on Massachusetts
soil, the oldest son has been snatched out
of life upon the threshold of his thirtieth
year. I carried into college with me an
indelible impression of the sudden and distressing
death of my father, at that period
of his prosperous career, and of the wild
cry of my widowed mother when she
clasped me to her breast, and prayed
Heaven might avert the doom from me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>"Everything that philosophy, science,
common sense, could bring to the task of
arguing me out of a belief in the transmission
of this sentence of a higher power
to me, has been tried. I have studied,
travelled, lived, enjoyed myself in a rational
way; have loved and won the one
woman upon earth for me, have revelled
in her wifely tenderness.</p>

<p>"I have tried to do my duty as a man
and a citizen. In all other respects, I believe
myself to be entirely rational, cool-headed,
unemotional; but I have never
been able to down that spectre. He is
present at every feast; and, although in
perfectly good health, I resolved yesterday
to put the question to a practical test. I
called at the office of an eminent specialist,
whom I had never met, although doubtless
he knew my name, as I knew his.</p>

<p>"Joining the throng of waiting folk in
Dr. &mdash;&mdash;'s outer office, I turned over the
leaves of the last number of <i>Punch</i>, with
what grim enjoyment of its <i>menu</i> of jocularity
you may conceive. When my turn
came, I asked for a complete physical examination.
But the doctor got no farther
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
than my heart before I was conscious of
awakening interest on his part. When the
whole business was over, he told me frankly
that in what he was pleased to call 'a magnificent
physique,' there was but one blemish,&mdash;a
spot upon the ripe side of a peach,&mdash;a
certain condition of the heart that
'might or might not' give serious trouble
in the future.</p>

<p>"'Might or might not'! How I envied
the smooth-spoken man of science
his ability to say these words so glibly!
While I took his medical advice,&mdash;that,
between us, was not worth a straw, and he
knew it, and I knew it,&mdash;I was thinking
of Ethel. I saw her face when she should
know the worst; and I became, immediately,
an abject, cringing, timorous thing,
that crept out of the doctor's office into
the spring sunshine, wondering why the
world was all a-cold.</p>

<p>"Here's where the lash hits me: I
should never have married Ethel; I should,
knowing my doom, have married no one
but some commonplace, platitudinous creature,
whom the fortune I shall leave behind
me would have consoled. But Ethel!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
high-strung, ardent, simple-hearted, worshipping
me far beyond my deserts! Why
did I condemn her, poor girl, to what is so
soon to come?</p>

<p>"On the fifteenth day of the coming
August, I shall have reached thirty years.
Before that day, the blow will fall upon
her, and it is my fault. You know, Cranbrooke,
that I do not fear death. What
manly soul fears death? It is only to the
very young, or to the very weak of spirit,
the King appears in all his terrors. Having
expected him so long and so confidently,
I hope I may meet him with a
courageous front. But Ethel! Ethel!</p>

<p>"She will be quite alone with me this
summer. Her mother and sisters have just
sailed for the other side, and I confess I
am selfish enough to crave her to myself
in the last hours. But some one she must
have to look after her, and whom can I
trust like you? I want you to promise to
come to us to spend your August holiday;
to be there, in fact, when&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the meantime, there must be no
suggestion of what I expect. She, least
of all, must suspect it. I should like to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
go out to the unknown with her light-hearted,
girlish laugh ringing in my ears.</p>

<p>"When we meet, as usual, you will
oblige me by saying nothing of this letter
or its contents. By complying with this
request, you will add one more&mdash;a final
one, dear old man&mdash;to the long list of
kindnesses for which I am your debtor;
and, believe me, dear Cranbrooke,</p>

<p class="left25">
"Yours, always faithfully,</p>

<p class="left65">"<span class="smcap">Maxwell Pollock</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>"Good heaven!" exclaimed Stephen
Cranbrooke, dropping the sheet as if it
burnt him, and sitting upright and aghast.
"So <i>this</i> is the cranny in Pollock's brain
where I have never before been able to
penetrate."</p>

<p>Later that day, Mr. Cranbrooke received
another epistle, prefaced by the
house address of the Maxwell Pollocks.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Dear Mr. Cranbrooke," this letter
ran, "Max tells me he has extended to
you an invitation to share our solitude <i>à
deux</i> in your August holiday. I need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
hardly say that I endorse this heartily; and
I hope you will not regret to learn that,
instead of going, as usual, to our great,
big, isolated country-place in New Hampshire,
I have persuaded Max to take a cottage
on the shore of Frenchman's Bay,
near Bar Harbor,&mdash;but not too near that
gay resort,&mdash;where he can have his sailboat
and canoe, and a steam-launch for
me to get about in. They say the sunsets
over the water there are adorable, and
Max has an artist's soul, as you know,
and will delight in the picturesque beauty
of it all.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you, confidentially, that
I have fancied a change of air and scene
might do him good this year. He is certainly
not ill; but is, as certainly, not
quite himself. I suppose you will think I
am a little goose for saying so; but I believe
if anything went wrong with Max,
I could never stand up against it. And
there is no other man in the world, than
you, whom I would ask to help me to find
out what it really is that worries him,&mdash;whether
ill-fortune, or what,&mdash;certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
not ill-health, for he is a model of splendid
vigor, as everybody knows, my beautiful
husband!"</p>
</div>
<p>"This is what she calls pleasant reading
for me," said plain, spare Stephen
Cranbrooke, with a whimsical twist of his
expressive mouth.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"At any rate," he read, resuming, "you
and I will devote ourselves to making it
nice for him up there. No man, however
he loves his wife, can afford to do altogether
without men's society; and it is so
hard for me to get Max to go into general
company, or to cultivate intimacy with
any man but you!</p>

<p>"There is a bachelor's wing to the cottage
we have taken, with a path leading
direct to the wharf where the boats are
moored; and this you can occupy by yourself,
having breakfast alone, as Max and I
are erratic in that respect. We shall have
a buckboard for the ponies, and our saddle-horses,
with a horse for you to ride;
and we shall pledge each other not to accept
a single invitation to anybody's house,
unless it please us to go there.</p>

<p>"Not less than a month will we take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
from you, and I wish it might be longer.
Perhaps you may like to know there is no
other man Max would ask, and I should
want, to be 'one of us' under such circumstances.</p>

<p class="left25">
"Always cordially yours,</p>

<p class="left65">"<span class="smcap">Ethel Pollock</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>"I asked her for bread, and she gave
me a stone," he quoted, with a return of
the whimsical expression. "Well! neither
he nor she has ever suspected my infatuation.
I am glad she wrote as she did,
though, for it makes the watch I mean to
set over Max easier. After looking at his
case in every aspect, I am convinced there
is a remedy, if I can only find it."</p>

<p>A knock, just then, at the door of Mr.
Cranbrooke's comfortable bachelor sitting-room
was followed by the appearance inside
of it of a man, at sight of whom
Cranbrooke's careworn and puzzled countenance
brightened perceptibly.</p>

<p>"Ha! Shepard!" he said, rising to bestow
on the newcomer a hearty grip of the
hand. "Did you divine how much I
wanted to talk to a fellow who has pursued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
exactly your line of study, and one, too,
who, more than any other I happen to be
acquainted with, knows just how far mind
may be made to influence matter in preventing
catastrophe, when&mdash;but, there,
what am I to do? It's another man's
affair,&mdash;a confidence that must be held
inviolable."</p>

<p>"Give me the case hypothetically,"
said Shepard, dropping, according to custom,
into a leathern chair out at elbows but
full of comfort to the spine of reclining
man, while accepting one of Cranbrooke's
galaxy of famously tinted pipes.</p>

<p>"I think I will try to do so," rejoined
his friend, "since upon it hangs the weal
or woe of two people, in their way more
interesting to me than any others in the
world."</p>

<p>"I am all ears," said Dr. Shepard, fixing
upon Cranbrooke the full gaze of a
pair of deep-set orbs that had done their
full share of looking intelligently into the
mystery of cerebral vagaries. Cranbrooke,
as well as he could, told the gist of Pollock's
letter, expressing his opinion that
to a man of the writer's temperament the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
conviction of approaching death was as
good as an actual death-warrant.</p>

<p>Shepard, who asked nothing better than
an intelligent listener when launched upon
his favorite theories, kept the floor for fifteen
minutes in a brilliant offhand discourse
full of technicalities intermingled
with sallies of strong original thought, to
which Cranbrooke listened, as men in
such a case are wont to do, in fascinated
silence.</p>

<p>"But this is generalizing," the doctor
interrupted himself at last. "What you
want is a special discussion of your friend's
condition. Of course, not knowing his
physical state, I can't pretend to say how
long it is likely to be before that heart-trouble
will pull him up short. But the
merest tyro knows that men under sentence
from heart-disease have lived their
full span. It is the obsession of his mind,
the invasion of his nerves by that long-brooding
idea, that bothers me. I am inclined
to think the odds are he will go mad
if he doesn't die."</p>

<p>"Good God, Shepard!" came from his
friend's pale lips.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't that what <i>you</i> were worrying
about when I came in? Yes&mdash;you
needn't answer. You think so, too; and
we are not posing as wise men when we
arrive at that simple conclusion."</p>

<p>"What on earth are we to do for him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, unless it be to distract
his mind by some utterly unlooked-for
concatenation of circumstances. Get his
wife to make love to another man, for instance."</p>

<p>"Shepard, you forget; these are my
nearest friends."</p>

<p>"And you forget I am a sceptic about
a love between the sexes that cannot be
alienated," answered the little doctor,
coolly.</p>

<p>Cranbrooke had indeed, for a moment,
lost sight of his confidant's dark page of
life&mdash;forgotten the experience that, years
ago, had broken up the doctor's home, and
made of him a scoffer against the faith of
woman. He was silent, and Shepard went
on with no evidence of emotion.</p>

<p>"When that happened to <i>me</i>, it was a
dynamite explosion that effectually broke
up the previous courses of thought within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
me; and, naturally, the idea occurs to me
as a specific for the case of your melancholy
friend. Seriously, Cranbrooke, you
could do worse than attack him from some
unexpected quarter, in some point where
he is acutely sensitive&mdash;play upon him,
excite him, distract him, and so carry him
past the date he fears."</p>

<p>"How could I?" asked Cranbrooke of
himself.</p>

<p>There was another knock; and, upon
Cranbrooke's hearty bidding to come in,
there entered no less a person than the
subject of their conversation.</p>

<p>Even the astute Shepard finished his
pipe and took his leave without suspecting
that the manly, healthy, clear-eyed, and
animated Maxwell Pollock had anything
in common with the possessed hero of
Cranbrooke's story. Cranbrooke, who had
dreaded a reopening of the subject of Pollock's
letter, was infinitely relieved to find
it left untouched.</p>

<p>The visit, lasting till past midnight, was
one of a long series dating back to the time
when they were undergraduates at the university.
There had never been a break in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
their friendship. The society of Cranbrooke,
after that of his own wife, was to
Pollock ever the most refreshing, the most
inspiring to high and manly thought. They
talked, now, upon topics grave and gay,
without hinting at the shadow overlying
all. Pollock was at his best; and his
friend's heart went out to him anew in a
wave of that sturdy affection "passing the
love of woman"&mdash;rare, perhaps, in our
material money-getting community, but,
happily, still existing among true men.</p>

<p>When the visitor arose to take leave,
he said in simple fashion: "Then I may
count on you, Cranbrooke, to stand by us
this summer?"</p>

<p>"Count on me in all things," Cranbrooke
answered; and the two shook
hands, and Pollock went his way cheerily,
as usual.</p>

<p>"Is this a dream?" Cranbrooke asked
himself, when left alone. "Can it be
possible that sane, splendid fellow is a victim
of pitiful hallucination, or that he is
really to be cut off in the golden summer
of his days. No, it can't be; it must
not be. He must be, as Shepard says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
'pulled up short' by main force. At any
cost, I must save him. But how? <i>Anyhow!</i>
Max must be made to forget himself&mdash;even
if I am the sacrifice! By
George! this <i>is</i> a plight I'm in! And
Ethel, who adores the ground he walks
upon! I shall probably end by losing
both of them, worse luck!"</p>

<p>The morning had struggled through
Cranbrooke's window-blinds before he
stirred from his fit of musing and went
into his bedroom for a few hours of
troubled sleep.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Pollock took possession
of their summer abiding-place on a
glorious day of refulgent June, such as, in
the dazzling atmosphere of Mount Desert
Island, makes every more southerly resort
on our Atlantic coast seem dull by comparison.
To greet them, they found a world
of fresh-washed young birches sparkling
in the sun; of spice-distilling evergreens,
cropping up between gray rocks; of staring
white marguerites, and huge, yellow,
satin buttercups, ablow in all the clearings;
of crisp, young ferns and blue iris, unfolding
amid the greenery of the wilder bits
of island; haunts that were soon, in turn,
to be blushing pink with a miracle of
brier-roses.</p>

<p>And what a charmed existence followed!
In the morning, they awoke to see the
water, beneath their windows, sparkle red
in the track of the rising sun; the islets
blue-black in the intense glow. All day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
they lived abroad in the virgin woods, or
on the bay in their canoe. And, after
sunsets of radiant beauty, they would fall
asleep, lulled by the lapping of little waves
upon the rock girdle that bound their lawn.
It was all lovely, invigorating, healthful.
Of the cottagers who composed the summer
settlement, only those had arrived
there who, like the Pollocks, wanted chiefly
to be to themselves.</p>

<p>In these early days of the season, Max
and Ethel liked to explore on horseback
the bosky roads that thread the island,
startling the mother partridge, crested and
crafty, from her nest, or sending her, in
affected woe, in a direction to lead one
away from where her brood was left; lending
themselves to the pretty comedy with
smiles of sympathy. Or else, they would
rifle the ferny combs of dew-laden blossoms,
all the while hearkening to the
spring chatter of birds that did their best
to give utterance to what wind-voice and
leaf-tone failed to convey to human comprehension.
Then, emerging from green
arcades, our equestrians would find themselves,
now, in some rocky haunt of primeval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
solitude facing lonely hilltops and
isolated tarns; now, gazing upon a stretch
of laughing sea framed by a cleft in the
highlands.</p>

<p>Another day, they would climb on foot
to some higher mountain top, and there,
whipped by tonic breezes, stand looking
down upon the wooded waves of lesser
summits, inland; and, seaward, to the
broad Atlantic, with the ships; and, along
the coast, to the hundreds of fiords, with
their burden of swirling waters!</p>

<p>Coming home from these morning expeditions
with spirit refreshed and appetite
sharpened, it was their custom to repair,
after luncheon, to the water, and by the
aid of sails, steam, or their own oars or
paddles, cut the sapphire bay with tracks
of argent brightness, or linger for many a
happy hour in the green shadow of the
sylvan shore.</p>

<p>The month of July was upon the wane
before husband and wife seemingly aroused
to the recollection that their idyl was about
to be interrupted by the invasion of a third
person. Ethel, indeed, had pondered regretfully
upon the coming of Cranbrooke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
for some days before she spoke of it to
her husband; while Max!&mdash;</p>

<p>The real purpose of Cranbrooke's visit,
dismissed from Pollock's mind with extraordinary
success during the earlier
weeks of their stay upon the island, had
by now assumed, in spite of him, the suggestion
of a death-watch set upon a prisoner.
He strove not to think of it. He
refrained from speaking of it. So delicious
had been to him the draft of Ethel's
society, uninterrupted by outsiders, in this
Eden of the eastern sea; so perfect their
harmony of thought and speech; so charming
her beauty, heightened by salt air and
outdoor exercise and early hours, Max
wondered if the experience had been sent
to him as an especial allowance of mercy
to the condemned. To the very day of
Cranbrooke's arrival, even after a trap had
been sent to the evening boat to fetch him,
the husband and wife refrained from discussing
the expected event.</p>

<p>It was the hour before sunset, following
a showery afternoon; and, standing together
upon their lawn to look at the western sky,
Max proposed to her to go out with him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
for awhile in the canoe. They ran like
children, hand in hand, to the wharf, where,
lifting the frail birch-bark craft from its
nest, he set it lightly afloat. Ethel, stepping
expertly into her place, was followed
by Max, who, in his loose cheviot shirt,
barearmed and bareheaded, flashing his
red-dyed paddle in the clear water, seemed
to her the embodiment of manly grace and
strength.</p>

<p>They steered out into the bay; and, as
they paused to look back upon the shore,
the glory of the scene grew to be unspeakable.
Behind the village, over which the
electric globes had not yet begun to gleam,
towered Newport, a rampart of glowing
bronze, arched by a rainbow printed upon
a brooding cloud. Elsewhere, the multicolored
sky flamed with changing hues,
reflected in a sea of glass. And out of
this sea arose wooded islands; and, far on
the opposite shore of the mainland, the
triple hills had put on a vestment of deepest
royal purple.</p>

<p>"I like to look away from the splendor,
to the side that is in shadow," said Ethel.
"See, along that eastern coast, how the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
reflected sunlight is flashed from the windows
on that height, and the blue columns
of hearth smoke arise from the chimneys!
Doesn't it make you somehow rejoice
that, when the color fades, as it soon must,
we shall still have our home and the lights
we make for ourselves to go back to?"</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>"What has set you to moralizing,
dear?" he asked, trying to conceal that
he had winced at her innocent question.</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing. Only, when one is supremely
happy, as I am now, one is afraid
to believe it will endure. How mild the
air is to-night! Look over yonder, Max;
the jewelled necklace of Sorrento's lights
has begun to palpitate. Let us paddle
around that fishing-schooner before we
turn."</p>

<p>"Ethel, you are crying."</p>

<p>"Am I? Then it is for pure delight.
I think, Max, we had never so fine an
inspiration as that of coming to Mount
Desert. My idea of the place has always
been of a lot of rantipole gaieties, and people
crowded in hotels. While this&mdash;it is
a little like Norway, and a great deal like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Southern Italy. Besides, when before
have we been so completely to ourselves
as in that gray stone lodge by the waterside,
with its hood of green ivy, and the
green hill rising behind it? Let us come
every year; better still, let us build ourselves
a summer home upon these shores."</p>

<p>"Should you like me to buy the cottage
we now have, so that you can keep it to
come to when you like?"</p>

<p>"When <i>you</i> like, you mean. Max, it
can't be you have caught cold in this soft
air, but your voice sounds a little hoarse.
Well! I suppose we must go in, for Mr.
Cranbrooke will be arriving very soon."</p>

<p>Ethel's sigh found an echo in one from
her husband, at which the April-natured
young woman laughed.</p>

<p>"There, it's out! We don't want even
Cranbrooke, do we? To think the poor,
dear man's coming should have been oppressing
both of us, and neither would be
first to acknowledge it! After all, Max
darling, it is your fault. It was you who
proposed Cranbrooke. I knew, all along,
that I'd be better satisfied with you alone.
Now, we must just take the consequence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
of your overhasty hospitality, and make
him as happy as we are&mdash;if we can."</p>

<p>"If we can!" said Max; and she saw
an almost pathetic expression drift across
his face&mdash;an expression that bewildered
her.</p>

<p>"Why do you look so rueful over him?"</p>

<p>"I am thinking, perhaps, how hard it
will be for him to look at happiness through
another man's eyes."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Mr. Cranbrooke is quite
satisfied with his own lot. He is one of
those self-contained men who could never
really love, I think," said Mrs. Pollock,
conclusively.</p>

<p>"He has in some way failed to show
you his best side. He has the biggest,
tenderest heart! I wish there was a woman
fit for him, somewhere. But Stephen will
never marry, now, I fear. She who gets
him will be lucky&mdash;he is a very tower of
strength to those who lean on him."</p>

<p>"As far as strength goes, Max, you
could pick him up with your right hand.
It may be silly, but I do love your size
and vigor; when I see you in a crowd of
average men, I exult in you. Imagine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
any woman who could get <i>you</i> wanting
a thin, sallow person like Cranbrooke!"</p>

<p>"He can be fascinating, when he
chooses," said Max.</p>

<p>"The best thing about Cranbrooke,
Max, is that he loves you," answered his
wife, wilfully.</p>

<p>"Then I want you, henceforth, to try
to like him better, dear; to like him for
himself. He is coming in answer to my
urgent request; and I feel certain the more
you know of him, the more you will trust
in him. At any rate, give him as much of
your dear self as I can spare, and you will
be sure of pleasing me."</p>

<p>"Max, now I believe it is you who are
crying because you are too happy. I
never heard such a solemn cadence in your
voice. I don't want a minute of this
lovely time to be sad. When we were in
town, I fancied you were down&mdash;about
something; now, you are yourself again;
let me be happy without alloy. I am determined
to be the <i>cigale</i> of the French
fable, and dance and sing away the summer.
Between us, we may even succeed
in making that sober Cranbrooke a reflection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
of us both. There, now, the light
has faded; quicken your speed; we must
go ashore and meet him. See, the moon
has risen&mdash;O Max darling, to please me,
paddle in that silver path!"</p>

<p>This was the Ethel her husband liked
best to see,&mdash;a child in her quick variations
of emotion, a woman in steadfast tenderness.
Conquering his own strongly excited
feeling, he smiled on her indulgently;
and when, their landing reached, Cranbrooke's
tall form was descried coming
down the bridge to receive them, he was
able to greet his friend with an unshadowed
face.</p>

<p>The three went in to dinner, which
Ethel, taking advantage of the soft, dry
air, had ordered to be served in a <i>loggia</i>
opening upon the water. The butler, a
sympathetic Swede, had decked their little
round table with wild roses in shades of
shell-pink, deepening to crimson. The
candles, burning under pale-green shades,
were scarcely stirred by the faint breeze.
Hard, indeed, to believe that, upon occasion,
that couchant monster, the bay, could
break up into huge waves, ramping shoreward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
leaping over the rock wall, upon the
lawn, up to the <i>loggia</i> floor, and there
beat for admission to the house, upon
storm-shutters hastily erected to meet its
onslaught!</p>

<p>To-night, a swinging lantern of wrought
iron sent down through its panels of opal
glass a gentle illumination upon three well-pleased
faces gathered around the dainty
little feast. Ethel, who, in the days of
gipsying, would allow no toilets of ceremony,
retained her sailor-hat, with the
boat-gown of white serge, in which her
infantile beauty showed to its best advantage.
Cranbrooke was dazzled by the
new bloom upon her face, the new light
in her eye.</p>

<p>Pollock, too, tall, broad-shouldered,
blonde, clean-shaven save for a mustache,
his costume of white flannel enhancing
duly the transparent healthiness of his
complexion, looked wonderfully well&mdash;so
Cranbrooke thought and said.</p>

<p>"Does he not?" cried Ethel, exultingly.
"I knew you would think so.
Max has been reconstructed since we have
lived outdoors in this wonderful air. Just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
wait, Mr. Cranbrooke, till we have done
with you, and you, too, will be blossoming
like the rose."</p>

<p>"I, that was a desert, you would say,"
returned Cranbrooke, smiling. Involuntarily
it occurred to him to contrast his
own outer man with that of his host.
Somehow or other, the fond, satisfied look
Ethel bestowed upon her lord aroused
anew in their friend an old, teasing spirit
of envy of nature's bounty to another,
denied to him.</p>

<p>As the moon transmuted to silver the
stretch of water east of them, and the three
sat over the table, with its <i>carafes</i> and decanters
and egg-shell coffee-cups, till the
flame of a cigar-lighter died utterly in its
silver beak, their talk touching all subjects
pleasantly, Cranbrooke persuaded himself
he had indeed been dreaming a bad
dream. The journey thither, of which
every mile had been like the link of a
chain, was, for him, after all, a mere essay
at pleasure-seeking. He had come on to
spend a jolly holiday with a couple of the
nicest people in the world&mdash;nothing more!
His fancies, his plans, his devices, conceived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
in sore distress of spirit, were relegated
to the world of shadows, whence
they had been summoned.</p>

<p>When Ethel left the two men for the
night, and the butler came out to collect
his various belongings, Pollock rose and
bade Cranbrooke accompany him to see
the mountains from the other side of the
house. Here, turning their backs on the
enchantment of the water view, they looked
up at an amphitheatre of hills, dominated
in turn by rocky summits gleaming in the
moon. But for the lap of the water upon
the coast, the stir of a fresh wind arising
to whisper to the leaves of a clump of
birches, Mother Earth around them was
keeping silent vigil.</p>

<p>"What a perfect midsummer night!"
said Cranbrooke, drawing a deep breath of
enjoyment. "After the heat and dust of
that three hundred miles of railway journey
from Boston, this <i>is</i> a reward!"</p>

<p>"We chose better than we knew the
scene of my euthanasia," answered Pollock,
without a tremor in his voice.</p>

<p>A thrill ran through Cranbrooke's veins.
He could have sworn the air had suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
become chill, as if an iceberg had floated
into the bay. He tried to respond, and
found himself babbling words of weak
conventionality; and all the while the soul
of the strong man within him was saying:
"It must not be. It shall not be. If I
live, I shall rescue you from this ghastly
phantom."</p>

<p>"Don't think it necessary to give words
to what you feel for me," said Pollock,
smiling slightly. "You are not making a
brilliant success of it, old man, and you'd
better stop. And don't suppose I mean to
continue to entertain my guest by lugubrious
discussions of my approaching <i>finale</i>.
Only, it is necessary that you should know
several things, since the event may take
us unawares. I have made you my executor,
and Ethel gets all there is; that's the
long and short of my will, properly signed,
attested, and deposited with my lawyer before
I left town. Ethel's mother and sisters
will be returning to Newport in a
fortnight, and they will, no doubt, come
to the poor child when she needs them.
There <i>must</i> be some compensation for a
decree of this kind, and I have it in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
absolute bliss I have enjoyed since we
came here. That child-wife of mine is
the most enchanting creature in the world.
If I were not steeped in selfishness, I
could wish she loved me a little less. But
all emotions pass, and even Ethel's tears
will dry."</p>

<p>"Good Heaven, Max, you are talking
like a machine! One would think this
affair of yours certain. Who are you, to
dare to penetrate the mystery of the decrees
of your Maker&mdash;"</p>

<p>"None of that, if you please, Cranbrooke,"
interrupted Pollock; "I have
fought every inch of the way along there,
by myself, and have been conquered by
my conviction. Did I tell you that my
father, before me, struggled with similar
remonstrances from <i>his</i> friends? The parsons
even brought bell and book to exorcise
his tormentor&mdash;and all in vain. He
was snuffed out in full health, as I shall be,
and why should I whine at following him?
Come, my dear fellow, I am keeping you
out of a capital bed, from sleep you must
require. There's but one matter in
which you can serve me,&mdash;take Ethel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
into your care. Win her fullest confidence;
let her know that when I am not
there, <i>you will be</i>."</p>

<p>Cranbrooke went to his room, but not
to rest. When his friends next saw him,
he was returning from a solitary cruise
about the bay in a catboat Pollock kept
at anchor near their wharf.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Cranbrooke!" cried Ethel,
lightly. "The boatman says you have
been out ever since daybreak. But that
we espied the boat tacking about beyond
that far rock, I should have been for sending
in search of you."</p>

<p>"Cranbrooke is an accomplished sailor,"
said Max. "But just now, breakfast's
the thing for him, Ethel. See that he is
well fed, while I stroll out to the stable
and look after the horses."</p>

<p>As he crossed the greensward, Ethel's
gaze followed him, till he disappeared behind
a clump of trees. Then she turned
to her guest.</p>

<p>"Let me serve you with all there is,
until they bring you something hot," she
said, with her usual half-flippant consideration
of him. "Do you know you look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
very seedy? I have, for my part, no patience
with these early morning exploits."</p>

<p>"If you could have seen the world
awakening as I saw it, this morning, you
would condone my offence," he answered,
a curious expression Ethel thought she
had detected in his eyes leaving them unclouded,
as he spoke.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>No one who knew Stephen Cranbrooke
well could say he did anything
by halves. In the days that followed
his arrival at Mount Desert, Max
Pollock saw that his friend was lending
every effort to the task of establishing
friendly relations with his wife. From her
first half-petulant, half-cordial manner
with him,&mdash;the manner of a woman who
tries to please her husband by recognition
of the claim of his nearest male intimate,&mdash;Ethel
had passed to the degree of manifestly
welcoming Cranbrooke's presence,
both when with her husband and without
him.</p>

<p>As Max saw this growing friendship, he
strove to increase it by absenting himself
from Ethel, instead of, as heretofore,
spending every hour he could wring from
the society of other folk, in the light of
her smiles. His one wish that Ethel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
might be insensibly led to find another
than himself companionable; that she
might be, though never so little, weaned
from her absolute dependence upon him for
daily happiness, before the blow fell that
was to plunge her in darkest night, kept
him content in these acts of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>But, as was inevitable, his manner
toward them both underwent a trifling
change. His old buoyancy of affection
was succeeded by a quiet, at times wistful,
recognition of the fact that his friend and
his wife had now found another interest
besides himself. But he was proud to see
Cranbrooke had justified his boast that he
"could be fascinating when he chose;"
and he was glad to think Cranbrooke at
last realized the charm Ethel, apparently
a mere bright bubble upon the tide of society,
had to a man of intellect and heart.
"It was as I said," the poor fellow repeated
to himself, trying to find comfort
in the realization of his prescience; and
when Ethel, alone with him, would break
into pæans of his friend, and wonder how
she could have been so blind to the "real
man" before, Max answered her loyally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
that his highest wish for both of them was
at last gratified.</p>

<p>Then the day came when there was
question of a companion for Ethel in a
sailing-party to which she had accepted an
invitation&mdash;and for Max was destined
an emotion something like distaste.</p>

<p>They were sitting over the breakfast
table,&mdash;a meal no longer exclusive to
wife and husband, as had been agreed, but
shared by Cranbrooke with due regularity,&mdash;when
Ethel broached the subject.</p>

<p>"You know, Max, I was foolish enough
to promise that irresistible Mrs. Clayton&mdash;when
she would not take no for an
answer, yesterday,&mdash;that <i>some</i> of us would
join her water party to-day. It is to be
an idle cruise, with no especial aim&mdash;luncheon
on board their schooner-yacht;
the sort of thing I knew would bore you
to extinction&mdash;being huddled up with the
same people half the day."</p>

<p>"It is the opening wedge&mdash;if you go
to this, you will be booked for others,
that's all," said Max, preparing to say, in
a martyrized way, that he would accompany
her, if she liked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I knew you would feel that; and
so I told her she must really excuse my
husband, but that I had no doubt Mr.
Cranbrooke would accept with pleasure.
You see, Mr. Cranbrooke, what polite inaccuracies
you are pledged by friendship
to sustain."</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> go with pleasure," Stephen said,
with what Max thought almost unnecessary
readiness.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Ethel. "This is the
hero's spirit. And so, Max dear, you
will have a long day to yourself while I
am experimenting in fashionable pleasuring,
and Mr. Cranbrooke is representing
you in keeping an eye on me."</p>

<p>"You will, of course, be at home to
dinner?" said her husband.</p>

<p>"Surely. Unless breezes betray us, and
we are driven to support exhausted nature
upon hardtack and champagne; for, of
course, all of the Claytons' luncheon will
be eaten up, and there are no stores aboard
a craft like that. Will you order the
buckboard for ten, dear? We rendezvous
at the boat-wharf. And, as there is no
telling when we shall be in, don't trouble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
to send to meet me. Mr. Cranbrooke and
I will pick up a trap to return in."</p>

<p>Max saw them off in the buckboard;
and, as Ethel turned at some little distance
and looked back at him, where he
still stood on the gravel before their vine-wreathed
portal, waving her hand with a
charming grace, then settling again to a
<i>tête-à-tête</i> with Cranbrooke, he felt vaguely
resentful at being left behind.</p>

<p>The clear, dazzling atmosphere, the
sense of youthful vitality in his being,
made him repel the idea of exclusion from
any function of the animated world. He
almost thought Ethel should have given
him a chance to say whether or no he
would accompany her. Was it not, upon
her part, even a little bit&mdash;a <i>very</i> little bit,
lacking in proper wifely feeling, to be so
prompt in dispensing with his society, to
accept that of others for a whole, long,
bright summer's day of pleasuring?</p>

<p>This suggestion he put away from him
as quickly as it came. He was like a
spoiled child, he said to himself, who does
not expect to be taken at his word. Ethel
well knew his dislike of gossiping groups
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
of idle people; equally well she remembered,
no doubt, his frequent requests that
she would mingle more with the world,
take more pleasure on her own account.
And Cranbrooke,&mdash;dear old Cranbrooke,&mdash;of
course he was ready to punish himself
by going off on such a party, when it was
an opportunity to serve his friend!</p>

<p>So Max put his discontent away, and,
mounting his horse, went off alone for a
ride half around the island, lunching at
Northeast Harbor, and returning, through
devious ways, by nightfall.</p>

<p>Restored to healthy enjoyment of all
things by his day in the saddle, he turned
into the avenue leading to their house,
buoyed up by the sweet hope of Ethel
returned&mdash;Ethel on the watch for him.
Already, he saw in fancy the gleam of her
jaunty white yachting-costume between
the tubs of flowering hydrangeas ranged
on either side the walk before their door.
The lamps inside&mdash;the "home lights," of
which she had once fondly spoken to him&mdash;were
already lighted. She would, perhaps,
be worrying at his delay. He quickened
his speed, and rode down the avenue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
to the house at a brisk trot. The groom,
who, from the stable, had heard the horse's
feet, started up out of the shrubbery to
meet him. But there was no other indication
of a watch upon the movements of
the master of the house.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pollock has not returned, then?"
he asked, conscious of blankness in his
tone.</p>

<p>"No, sir; not yet. Our orders were,
not to send for her, sir, as there was no
knowing when the party would get in."</p>

<p>"Yes, the breeze has pretty much died
out since sunset," said Pollock, endeavoring
to mask his disappointment by commonplace.</p>

<p>He went indoors; and the house, carefully
arranged though it was, with flowers
and furniture disposed by expert hands to
greet the returning of the master, seemed
to him dull and chill. He ordered a cup
of tea for himself, and, bending down, put
a match to the little fire of birch-wood
always kept laid upon the hearth of their
picturesque hall sitting-room.</p>

<p>In a moment, the curling wreathes of
pale azure that arose upon the pyre of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
silvery-barked logs was succeeded by a
generous flame. The peculiarly sweet
flavor of the burning birch was distilled
upon the air. Sipping the cup of tea, as
he stood in his riding-clothes before the
fire, Max felt a consoling warmth invade
his members and expand his heart.</p>

<p>"They will be in directly," he said;
"and, by George, I shall be as ready for
my dinner as they for theirs."</p>

<p>In one corner of the hall stood a tall,
slender-necked vase, where he had that
morning watched Ethel arranging a sheaf
of goldenrod with brown-seeded marsh-grasses,&mdash;a
combination her touch had
made individual and artistic to a striking
degree. He recalled how, as she had finished
it, she looked around, calling him
and Stephen from their newspapers to admire
her handiwork. He, the husband,
had admired it lazily from his divan of
cushions in the corner. Cranbrooke had
gone over to stand beside his hostess, and
thence they had passed, still in close conversation,
out to the grassy terrace above
the sea.</p>

<p>Now, why should this recollection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
awaken in Max Pollock a new sense of
the feeling he had been doing his best to
dispose of all day? He could not say;
but there it was, to prick him with its invisible
sting. Then, too, the dinner-hour
was past, and he was hungry.</p>

<p>He went out upon the veranda at the
rear, and surveyed the expanse of water.
Far off, between the electric ball that hung
over the wharf of the village, and the point
of Bar Island, opposite, he saw a bridge of
lights from yachts of all sorts, with which
the harbor was now full. He fancied a
little moving star of light, that seemed to
creep beneath the large ones, might be the
Claytons' boat on her return, and, after
another interval of watching, called up a
wharf authority by telephone, and asked
if the <i>Lorelei</i> was in.</p>

<p>"Not yet, sir," was the reply. "Probably
caught out when the wind fell. Will
let you know the minute they are in sight."
With which assurance Mr. Pollock was
finally driven by the pangs of natural appetite
to sit down alone to a cheerless meal.</p>

<p>There was a message by telephone, as
he finished his repast. The <i>Lorelei</i> was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
in, and Mrs. Pollock desired to speak with
her husband.</p>

<p>"We're all right," Ethel's voice said,
"and I hope you haven't been worried.
They <i>insist</i> on our going to dinner at a
restaurant, and, of course, you understand,
I can't spoil the fun by refusing. <i>Couldn't</i>
you come down and meet us?"</p>

<p>His first impulse was to say yes; but a
second thought withheld him. He gave
her a pleasant answer, however, bidding
her enjoy herself without thought of him,
and adding: "Cranbrooke will look out
for you and bring you home."</p>

<p>It was quite ten o'clock when they arrived
at the cottage, Ethel in high spirits,
flushed with the excitement of a merry
day, full of chatter over people and things
Max had no interest in, appealing to
Cranbrooke to enjoy her retrospects with
her. She was "awfully sorry" about
having kept Max from his dinner; "awfully
sorry" not to have come home at
once, but there was no getting out of
the impromptu dinner; and, of course,
they had to wait for it; and she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
the first, after dinner, to make the move
to go; Mr. Cranbrooke would certify to
that.</p>

<p>"I don't need any certification, dear,"
said Max, gently; but he did not smile.
Cranbrooke, who sat with him after sleepy
Ethel had retired from the scene, felt his
heart wrung at thought of certain things
that never entered into Ethel's little head.
But he made no effort to dispel the cloud
that had settled over his friend's face.</p>

<p>By and by, Cranbrooke, too, said good-night,
and went off into his wing, and Max
was left alone with his cigar.</p>

<p>The day on the water had verified
Max's prediction that it would prove "an
opening wedge." Ethel, caught in the
tide of the season's gaieties, found herself
impelled from one entertainment to the
other; their cottage was invaded by callers,
their little informal dinners were
transformed into banquets of ceremony, as
choice and more lively than those of their
conventional life in town. The only persons
really satisfied by the change of habits
in the house were the servants, who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
like all artists, require a public to set the
seal upon their worth.</p>

<p>Max, bewildered, found himself sometimes
accompanying his wife to her parties;
oftener&mdash;struck with the ghastly
inappropriateness of his presence in such
haunts&mdash;stopping at home and deputing
to Cranbrooke the escort of his wife. To
his surprise, he perceived that Cranbrooke
was not only ready, but eager, on all occasions,
to carry Ethel away from him. But
then, of course, this was precisely what
he had wished.</p>

<p>And Ethel, who lost no opportunity to
tell Max how "good," how "lovely,"
Cranbrooke had been to her, was she not
carrying out to the letter her husband's
wishes? He observed, moreover, that
Ethel was even more impressed than he
had expected her to be with that quality
of "fascination." Cranbrooke's mind was
like a beautiful new country into which
she was making excursions, she said once;
and Max, after a moment's hesitation,
agreed with her very warmly.</p>

<p>At last, Maxwell Pollock awoke one
morning, with a start of disagreeable consciousness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
to the fact that this was the eve
of his thirtieth birthday. Occupied as he
had been with various thoughts that had to
do with his transient relations to this
sublunary sphere, he had actually allowed
himself to lose sight of the swift approach
of his day of doom. Now, he arose, took
his bath, dressed, and without arousing his
wife, who, in the room adjoining, slept
profoundly after a gay dance overnight,
went alone to the waterside, with the intention
of going out in his canoe.</p>

<p>Early as he was, Cranbrooke was before
him, carrying the canoe upon his
head, moving after the fashion of some
queer shelled-creature down to the float.</p>

<p>Max realized, with a sense of keen self-rebuke,
that the spectacle of his friend
was repellant to him, and the prospect of
a talk alone with Stephen on this occasion,
the last thing he would have chosen.</p>

<p>And&mdash;evidently a part of the latter-day
revolution of affairs&mdash;Cranbrooke
seemed to have forgotten that this day
meant more than another to Pollock. He
greeted him cheerily, in commonplace
terms, commented on their identity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
fancy in the matter of a paddle at sunrise,
and offered to relinquish the craft in favor
of its owner.</p>

<p>"Of course not. Get in, will you,"
said Max, throwing off his coat; and, taking
one of the paddles, while Cranbrooke
plied the other, their swift, even strokes
soon carried them far over toward the
illuminated east.</p>

<p>When well out upon the bay, they
paused to watch the red coming of the
sun. Beautiful with matin freshness was
the sleeping world around them; and, inspired
by the scene, Max, who was kneeling
in the bow, turned to exclaim to
Cranbrooke, with his old, hearty voice,
upon the reward coming to early risers in
such surroundings.</p>

<p>"Jove, a man feels born again when he
breathes air like this!"</p>

<p>Cranbrooke started. It was almost beyond
hope that Max should use such a
phrase, in such accents, at such a juncture.
Immediately, however, the exhilaration
died out of Pollock's manner; and, again
turning away his face, he showed that his
thoughts had reverted to the old sore spot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
He did not see the expression of almost
womanly yearning in Cranbrooke's face
when the certainty of this was fixed upon
his anxious mind.</p>

<p>The two men talked little, and of casual
things only, while abroad. As they returned
to the house, Cranbrooke made a
movement as if to speak out something
burning upon his tongue, and then, repressing
it, walked with hasty strides to
his own apartment.</p>

<p>The day passed as had done those immediately
preceding it. Calls, a party of
guests at luncheon, a drive, absorbed
Ethel's hours from her husband. When
she reached home, at tea-time, he had
come in from riding, and was standing
alone in the hall, awaiting her.</p>

<p>"How nice to find you here alone!"
she cried, going up to kiss him, and then
taking her place behind the tea-tray.
"Do sit down, and let us imagine we are
back in those dear old days before we
were overpowered by outsiders. Never
mind! The rush will soon be over; we
shall be to ourselves again, you and I and&mdash;how
stupid I am!" she added, coloring.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
"You and I, I mean, for he must go back
to town."</p>

<p>"You mean Cranbrooke?" he said, as
she thought, absent-mindedly, but in reality
with something like a cold hand upon
his heart, that for a moment gave him a
sense of physical apprehension. Had <i>it</i>
come, he wondered?</p>

<p>But no, this was not physical; this was
a shock of purely emotional displeasure.
Could he believe his ears, that Ethel, his
wife, had indeed blended another than
himself with her dream of returning solitude?</p>

<p>"Yes, it will be all over soon," he said,
mechanically. "Had you a pleasant
drive? And did you enjoy the box-seat
with Egmont?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Egmont, fortunately, can drive&mdash;if
he <i>can't</i> talk," she answered, lightly.
"I suppose I am fastidious, or else spoiled
for the conversation of ordinary men, after
what I have had recently from Cranbrooke.
By the way, Max dear, are you relentless
against going with us to-night, to the <i>fête</i>
at the canoe club? You needn't go inside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
the club-house, you know. It will
be lovely to look at, from the water."</p>

<p>"With <i>us</i>? Then Cranbrooke has already
promised?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; he could not leave
me in the lurch, could he, when my husband
is such an obstinate recluse?"</p>

<p>"And how do you intend to get there?"</p>

<p>"By water, stupid, of course; how
else? I will be satisfied with the rowboat,
if you won't trust me in the canoe;
but Mr. Cranbrooke is such an expert
with the paddle, I shouldn't think you
would object to letting me go with him.
It will be perfectly smooth water, and the
air is so mild. Do say I may go in the
canoe, dear; it's twice the fun."</p>

<p>"I think you know that, unless I take
you, it is my wish you go nowhere at night
in a canoe," he answered, coldly.</p>

<p>Ethel was more hurt at his tone than
disappointed by his refusal. She could not
think what had come over her husband,
of late, so often had this constrained manner
presented itself to her advance. She
set it down to her unwonted indulgence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
in society, and promised herself, with a
sigh of relinquishment, that, after this
summer, she would go back to her life
lived for Max alone.</p>

<p>Then, Cranbrooke coming in with two
or three visitors, who lingered till almost
dinner-time and were persuaded easily to
stop for dinner, there was no chance to
indulge in meditations, penitential or otherwise.
When her guests took their departure,
it was in the little steam-launch,
she and Cranbrooke accompanying the
party, and all bound for the <i>fête</i>, to be
given on a wooded island in the bay. As
they were leaving the house, something
impelled her to run back and, in the semi-darkness
of the veranda, seek her husband's
side.</p>

<p>"Max darling, kiss me good-by. Or,
if you want me, let me stay with you."</p>

<p>"No, no; I want you to enjoy every
moment while you can," he said, withdrawing
from her gaze to the shadow of
a vine-wreathed column.</p>

<p>"Max, your voice is strange. And
once, at dinner, I saw you looking at me,
and there was something in your eyes that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
frightened me. If you hadn't smiled, and
lifted your glass to pledge me, I should
not have known what to think."</p>

<p>"Ethel! Wife! Do you love me?" he
said, catching her to his heart.</p>

<p>"Max! Why, Max! You foolish boy,
we shall be seen."</p>

<p>"Tell me, and kiss me once more, my
own, my own!"</p>

<p>"They are all aboard except you, Mrs.
Pollock," a voice said; and, from the dew
of the lawn, Cranbrooke stepped upon the
veranda.</p>

<p>Max started violently, and let his wife
go from his embrace.</p>

<p>"You see how rude you are making me
toward our guests," said Ethel. "You
have my wrap, Mr. Cranbrooke? Good-night,
Max; and to-morrow I'll tell you
all about it. Better change your mind
and come after us, though."</p>

<p>"Max need not trouble to do so," put
in Cranbrooke, in a muffled voice. "As
usual, I will fill his place."</p>

<p>Max thought he almost hurried her
away. They went down the slope of the
lawn together; and, at the steep descent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
leading to the bridge, he saw Ethel stumble,
and Cranbrooke throw his arm around
her to steady her.</p>

<p>And now, a passion took possession of
Maxwell Pollock's being that impelled
him to the impetuous action of following
them to the wharf, and gesticulating
madly after the swift little steamer that
bore them away from him.</p>

<p>"He dared take her, did he, when she
would have stayed at a word from me? I
see all, now. Specious, false, damnably
false, he has snared her fancy in his net.
But she loves me, I'll swear she loves me,
and I'll snatch her from him, if it is with
the last effort of my strength. Is there
time? Well, what is to come, let it come!
While there's life in me, she is mine."</p>

<p>A moment, and he was afloat in the
canoe, no sign of weakness in his powerful
stroke with the paddle, no thought in
his brain but the one intense determination
of the male creature to wrest his beloved
from the hands of his rival.</p>

<p class="p2">Every one conceded this to be quite the
prettiest and most taking event of the season.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
The rustic club-house, its peaked
gable and veranda defined with strings of
colored lanterns, sent forth the music of a
band, while to its portal trooped maidens
and cavaliers, landing at the wharf from
every variety of craft. The woods behind
were linked with chains of light, the
shore below lit with bonfires, and more
evanescent eruptions of many-hued fireworks.
Rockets hissed through the air,
and broke in a rain of violet, green, and
crimson meteors, till the zenith was a tangled
mesh made by the trails of them; fire-balloons
arose and were lost among the
stars; little fire-boats, launched from vessels
stocked for the purpose, bore their
blazing cargoes out upon the tide; other
unnamed monsters were let loose to carry
apparent destruction zigzag through the
waves. Every attendant yacht, sloop,
launch, rowboat, or canoe, with which the
water about the island was covered, carried
quaint decoration in the guise of Chinese
lanterns. Some of the smaller boats were
arched with these; others tossed bouquets
of fiery bubbles into the air. Creeping
about at a snail's pace among the crowded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
boats, invisible canoes carried silent passengers;
an occasional "oh!" of exclamation
at the beauty of the scene, the only
contribution people felt inclined to make
to conversation. It was a pageant of bedazzlement,
as if witches, gnomes, spirits
of earth, air, and the underworld, had
mingled their resources to enchant the
eyes of mortals. And over all, sailed the
lady-moon serenely, forgotten, but sure that
her time would come again.</p>

<p>Max found his launch without difficulty,
on the outer circle of the amphitheatre
of light. As he had divined, it
was empty, save for the two boatmen.</p>

<p>"The ladies went ashore, sir," one of
his men said, in answer to his inquiry.
"All but Mrs. Pollock, sir."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pollock? Where is she, then?"
he asked, briefly.</p>

<p>"She took our rowboat, sir, and went
off on the water with one of the gentlemen.
Mr. Cranbrooke, I think it was;
and they ordered us to wait just here.
No good going ashore, sir, if you want to
see. It's better from this point, even, than
nearer in."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," said the master, and at
once his canoe moved off to be lost in the
crowd.</p>

<p>He had sought for them in vain, peering
into all the small boats whenever the
flash-light of the rockets, or the catharine-wheels
on the coast, lit the scene. Many
a tender interlude was thus revealed; but
of the two people he now longed with the
fever of madness to discover, he saw
nothing.</p>

<p>At last, in a burst from a candle rocket,
there was a glimpse of Ethel's red boat-cloak,
her bare, golden head rising above
it. She was sitting in the stern of the
rowboat, Cranbrooke beside her, their
bow above water, their oars negligently
trailing. Ethel's eyes were fixed upon the
glittering panorama; but Cranbrooke's
eyes were riveted on her.</p>

<p>With an oath, Max drove his paddle
fiercely into the sea. The canoe sped
forward like an arrow. Blind with anger,
he did not observe that he was directly in
the track of a little steamer laden with
new arrivals, turning in toward the wharf.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>A new day dawned before the doctors,
who had been all night battling for Maxwell
Pollock's life, left him restored to
consciousness, and reasonably secure of
carrying no lasting ill effect from the blow
on his head received by collision with the
steamer.</p>

<p>Carried under with his canoe, he had
arisen to full view in the glare from a
"set piece" of fireworks on the shore,
beside the boat containing Cranbrooke and
his wife. It was Cranbrooke, not Ethel,
who identified the white face coming to
the surface within reach of his hand, then
sinking again out of sight. It was Cranbrooke,
also, who sprang to Pollock's rescue,
and, floating with his inert body, was
dragged with him aboard the launch.</p>

<p>As the rosy light of the east came to
play upon Pollock's features, he opened
his eyes for the first time with a look
of intelligence. At his bedside, Ethel was
kneeling, her whole loving soul in her
gaze.</p>

<p>"Is this&mdash;I thought it was heaven,"
he said, feeling for her hand.</p>

<p>"It is heaven for me, now that I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
you back, my own darling," she answered,
through happy tears.</p>

<p>"Have I been here long?"</p>

<p>"A few hours since the accident. The
doctors say you will be none the worse
for it. And, Max dear, only think! This
is your birthday! Your thirtieth birthday!
Many, many, <i>many</i> happy returns!"
and she punctuated her wish with warm
kisses.</p>

<p>At that juncture, Cranbrooke came into
the room and stood at the side of the bed
opposite Ethel, who had no eyes for him,
but kept on gazing at her recovered treasure
as if she could never have enough.</p>

<p>Max, though aware of Stephen's presence,
made no movement of recognition,
till Ethel spoke in playful chiding.</p>

<p>"Darling! Where are your manners?
Aren't you going to speak to our friend,
and thank him for saving you&mdash;saving
you for <i>me</i>, thank God!"</p>

<p>She buried her face in the bed-clothes,
overcome with the recollection; but even
with the exquisite tenderness of her accents
thrilling in his ear, Max remained
obstinately dumb to Stephen Cranbrooke.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>"Forgive him; he is not himself!"
pleaded Ethel, as she saw Cranbrooke
about to go dejectedly out of the room.</p>

<p>"Some day he will understand me,"
answered Stephen, with a gallant effort at
self-control. Then, withdrawing, he murmured
to himself: "But he will never
know that, in playing with his edged tools,
it is I who have got the death-blow."</p>
